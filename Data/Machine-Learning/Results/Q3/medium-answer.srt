00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,790
In this video, we're going to talk about performance metrics in classification

2
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:07,591
So we created a logistic regression model based on this feature and let's talk about some terminology here

3
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:09,451
And true positive rate, in other words, recall or sensitivity, is a measure of how many are truly positive out of all the positive cases in the data

4
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:13,952
Precision is used when we want to be very sure about the action

5
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:23,172
All right, so let's talk about cross entropy as a performance metric

6
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:28,001
So, why do we want to use cross entropy and not accuracy

7
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:34,292
We can use other kinds of metric and they are all in this sklearn.metrics module

8
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:41,383
So for example I can predict Yp and then most of them requires Ytrue and then Yprediction.
