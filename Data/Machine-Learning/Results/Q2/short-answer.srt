00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,509
In this video, we're going to talk about linear regression

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:10,070
And we'll talk about how statistically significant these estimate values are

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:19,641
And our goal is to tweak this parameter by optimization so that the model makes a prediction that's close to the target as much as possible

00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,251
It is one of the simplest kind of supervised learning model.
