1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,958
Machine learning, we mentioned that machine learning several times during the talk about data science

2
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:11,298
So machine learning is part of data science and it is also a subfield of artificial intelligence

3
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:15,608
It focuses on learning algorithms and building models and training them on the data

4
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:21,946
Machine learning consists of different types of learning, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning

5
00:00:21,957 --> 00:00:26,257
Many machine learning models, they are coming from statistical learning

6
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:33,475
In industry, machine learning engineers can develop and test machine learning models and design machine learning experiments

7
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:39,686
And in intersection, when the AI algorithm is learning from the data, it is called machine learning

8
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:45,576
And particularly, if it deals with complex data with neural network architecture, it is called deep learning

9
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:50,295
And here is the Google trend on the term on machine learning and software engineering

10
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:53,185
Alright, that already sounds like ML is very cool

11
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:56,246
Machine learning is also a key component in Internet of Things

12
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:04,256
Smart sensors and smart devices produce a lot of data, and also machine learning plays a key role in analyzing those data

13
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,825
Here are some few examples of machine learning tasks

14
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:09,777
So brief review of machine learning problems

15
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:12,716
And we're going to focus on supervised learning
