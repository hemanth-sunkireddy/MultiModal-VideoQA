00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,958
Machine learning, we mentioned that machine learning several times during the talk about data science

2
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:09,269
Many machine learning models, they are coming from statistical learning

3
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:16,487
In industry, machine learning engineers can develop and test machine learning models and design machine learning experiments

4
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:19,547
Machine learning is also a key component in Internet of Things

5
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:25,777
So for example, prediction includes classification regression, and these are in supervised learning

6
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:35,326
And clustering, which groups the similar data points together, and anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction, they are in a category of unsupervised learning

7
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:38,267
And we're going to focus on supervised learning
