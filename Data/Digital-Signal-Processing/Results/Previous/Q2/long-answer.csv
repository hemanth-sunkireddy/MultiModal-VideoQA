2.srt,00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:54.980,"And then later on we can see that how this can be eliminated also. So, the next one is all of us know that speech basically coding that is whatever the speech we are recording or whatever may be the thing there are different ways of storing them, how to do the compression and other things. So, one of the example we will take it how we can. implemented or we will be looking at basically in this module."
44.srt,00:06:45.510 --> 00:07:13.960,"How we are going to do the processing of speech? So, we say that in speech coding in wireless systems all this thing 1G systems have analog speech transmission in that and we know that in 2G and 3G systems have digital speech and what is the type of source coding we are going to have it which is going to vary. So, we will see it in a while now."
44.srt,00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:53.310,"So, now, we will come to the digital speech. So, we say that speech coder why we need it device that converts speech to digital. So, we will be seeing that it can speech coding is bifurcated into it can be waveform coders or O coders. So, in this case you are seeing the span how it is varying."
46.srt,00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:34.829,"Namaste, welcome back to real time digital signal processing course. So, we are discussing about the speech coding, why do we need it. So, today we are going to continue with the speech coding."
46.srt,00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:56.779,"So, more natural quality speech that is slightly higher bit rate what we have to account for. So, this covers our speech coding. So, the application of speech coding what we will look in the next class. Happy learning and thank you for listening to this lecture."
48.srt,00:00:43.020 --> 00:01:10.689,"So, as a recap in the last class we did little bit on speech coding and then its applications. One of the application was LPC coding what we did both in MATLAB and then. So, the other applications you can look in and then see that how you can use the speech coding in different applications."
57.srt,00:51:23.279 --> 00:52:02.469,"So, next we went on to discuss about the speech coding techniques whether we had the waveform coders or coders. and you can see that what kind of applications they use which are the bands what it is going to be used. And one of the example what we took was one of the students project to show that LPC coding how it can be done both analysis and synthesis and then reconstruct your voice at the receiving gate almost equivalent we will not say same, but at least it is going to match with whatever voice it was getting generated."
