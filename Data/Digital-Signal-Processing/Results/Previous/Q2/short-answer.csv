2.srt,00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:23.279,And then later on we can see that how this can be eliminated also
44.srt,00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:48.190,"So, we will be seeing that it can speech coding is bifurcated into it can be waveform coders or O coders"
46.srt,00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.829,"So, today we are going to continue with the speech coding"
46.srt,00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:42.809,"So, more natural quality speech that is slightly higher bit rate what we have to account for"
46.srt,00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.119,"So, the application of speech coding what we will look in the next class"
48.srt,00:00:51.490 --> 00:01:01.230,One of the application was LPC coding what we did both in MATLAB and then
57.srt,00:51:32.909 --> 00:51:39.899,and you can see that what kind of applications they use which are the bands what it is going to be used.
