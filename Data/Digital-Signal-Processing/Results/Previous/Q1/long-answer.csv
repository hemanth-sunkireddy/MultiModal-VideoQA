9.srt,00:19:46.389 --> 00:20:00.139,"So, coming to comparison between FIR versus IAR. So, we will take up IR filter more detailed one next few classes. What is the comparison."
12.srt,00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:45.170,"Welcome back once again to real time digital signal processing course. So, today we will discuss about IR filters. So, as a recap in the last two classes we discussed about FIR filters, their linear phase and how we can represent them, how we can design using the window techniques."
14.srt,00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:41.700,"So, for that FIR filters will have higher order whereas, IR filters what we can achieve is with the lower. So, the factor may be 4 lower compared to higher FIR filters. Coming to minimum order design when we want to do the thing."
14.srt,00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:21.539,"So, for the same magnitude what we said. So, IR filter needs order 2 whereas, FIR filter needs 12th order then number of multiplications in this is going to be 12 h 0 to h 11. And then whereas, in the IR filter because it is second order."
18.srt,00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:46.480,"So, I can give the same target as my code composer studio. So, you will be seeing now from the FIR filter you have got both numerator and then denominator coming in. So, IR filter as we know it is a feedback concept what it is going to use. So, it will be having both numerator and denominator."
19.srt,00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:11.980,"So, just the last slide to wind up our IR filter. So, we will be seeing the comparison between our FIR and IR filter. Few of the parameters what you can see the thing, one or two I will specify and rest of it you can go through."
34.srt,00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:43.170,"So, we have discussed about the linear filters. So, it should be triggering in your mind that both FIR and IR filters we used in the previous classes we have a. They are called linear filters, it is not linear phase filters, they are linear filters. Output is linear function of the filter input."
47.srt,00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:28.699,"Now, in the synthesis part of it, it is the IR filter. So, now, it must be triggering because the coefficients we have to keep the same a naught a 1 a 2 a 3. So, here it is IR filter whereas, in the analysis we use the FIR filter."
