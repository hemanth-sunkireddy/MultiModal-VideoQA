2.srt,00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:54.670,"So, in this case only discrete cosine transform what we will be looking at. So, we will be seeing how fast. 8.1 ddct implementation in using code composer studio we can implement."
48.srt,00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:43.020,"Welcome back to real time digital signal processing course. So today we will discuss about discrete cosine transform. So, how we can implement using both MATLAB and then the DSP processor what we will be looking at it. So, before giving the demo, so we will have little on the theory part of it."
48.srt,00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:15.579,"So, that is joint program extend group actually what it is. So, here what are the steps involved in it. So, we know that we need discrete cosine transform usually it is being used for compression."
49.srt,00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:46.670,"So we are discussing about discrete cosine transform in image processing. So we will continue in today's class also. So, in the last class we discussed about discrete cosine transform where it is being used we know that it is in JPEG compression."
51.srt,00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:37.729,"Namaste, welcome back to real time digital signal processing course. Last class we discussed about discrete cosine transform in 1D how we are going to reconstruct the 2D form. So, today we will continue discrete cosine transform."
52.srt,00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:30.750,Welcome back to real time digital signal processing course. So in the last class we are discussing about the discrete cosine transform. So we will continue.
52.srt,00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:49.599,"So, the we know that this is how we have introduced our DCT that is discrete cosine transform. So, we know that it is going to store the cosine waves. them to a set of coefficients what we have given the values here."
57.srt,00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:48.599,"And, later on for a lengthy signal how we can work on using a overlap add and then overlap same method to implement the same using RFFT. So, then we went on to discuss about discrete cosine transform that is little on image processing what we did the thing. So, how the DC value is going to be maximum in case of discrete cosine transform. And then where are the low frequencies present and medium and then high frequencies."
