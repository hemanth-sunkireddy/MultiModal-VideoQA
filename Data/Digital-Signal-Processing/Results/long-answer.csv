22.srt,00:07:02.959 -> 00:07:22.920,"Coming to discrete Fourier transform. So, what we have is it this is we call it as a finite duration. whereas, DTFT was discrete in time, but frequency was continuous in omega. Here both frequency and then time have been discretized."
22.srt,00:26:17.199 --> 00:26:33.429,"So, this is what the relationship with respect to. Z transform and then DFT. So, now we will assume that how to go with we said that DFT is a periodic function."
24.srt,00:14:53.750 -> 00:15:50.200,"As the previous slide shows that what was the initial thing, but here all of them are 1. So, we are not getting back in this case ok. So, now, what is the relation between our DTFT, DTFS and then DFT. So, x of n for all n if I take the DTFT then it becomes x of omega for all omega. and then the periodic signal in the time domain x p of n for all n and if you take a discrete time Fourier series then it is going to become x of k for all k. So, we say that x tilde of n that is periodic DFT if I take it results in the periodic x of k. So, here x of n periodic what we are represented instead of x p of n."
30.srt,00:19:55.670 -> 00:21:06.089,"This is how both of them decimation in time and decimation in frequency work for your analysis and synthesis equivalent of DFT. Now, some of the important DFT properties we are seeing in this slide. So, the properties of DFT are different from those typical what we use it for discrete time Fourier series and discrete time Fourier transform because they are circular in nature. So, that is they apply to the periodic repetition of the signal. Here you can have DTFS or DTFT, it can be this thing continuous signal minus infinity to infinity whereas, this uses a circular property. So, the first one is your notation what is it time domain is represented as x of n and frequency domain we represent it as x of k. So, the first one is the periodicity. So, x of n is equal to x of n plus capital N is nothing, but this thing what will be getting it x of n itself."
