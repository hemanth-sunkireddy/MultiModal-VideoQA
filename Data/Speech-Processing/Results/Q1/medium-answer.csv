1.srt,00:16:01.469 --> 00:16:12.019,"So, even if speech research, I will told that ASR, lot of people are doing research in ASR, automatic speech recognition"
1.srt,00:15:56.799 --> 00:16:01.469,"And if you worry about that, there is a HMM model, hidden Markov tool, Krismith model, where people are saying that now people are saying that this model is not sufficient for those language"
