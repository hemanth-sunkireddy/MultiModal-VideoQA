1.srt,00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:10.370,So there is a lot of problem I will solve using the speech perception and speech production
16.srt,00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:23.710,"So, let us discuss that we have discussed about the speech perception ok"
16.srt,00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.460,"So, this class I will may be it is required two lectures"
16.srt,00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:48.059,"So, if you ask the why we have to know about the human speech perception because if I talk about the digital speech processing then why we require that we should know that digital speech perception the speech perception kind of things"
16.srt,00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:24.079,Now if you if you see that human being ultimately we want to copy the human being through a machine or you can say we want to developed an algorithm or technology by which a machine can act as a human being or we can use the speech communication among the human being and that communication we want to establish in machine ok
16.srt,00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:31.900,"Now, if I want to do that in speech communication if you see speech production and speech perception"
