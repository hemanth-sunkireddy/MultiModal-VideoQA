1.srt,00:04:52.220 -> 00:05:19.829,"you record your name you should able to record that ah that speech in a computer using a computer then using some ah you can say that open source softwares there are many speech processing softwares which are available using those software you should able to view the spectrogram and time domain signal and level the different speech signal point so for example suppose i say the level that a consonant to vowel or stop consonant to vowel transition so those things you will learn here how do i level which is top concern what is look like in speech domain and what is the transitory part what is content so those things you learn this course and you should able to use that knowledge for a labeling the speech signal for a given or of a given speech signal whatever i said that you can so in examination also i will sometimes i give you a spectrogram and told you that identify the words based on the manner of articulation of the speech so i can expect that you should develop a skill not that theory what is top concern what is articulatory place of that velar that palatal not all kind of things but given a speech signal i should able to categorize and level the speech signal next one explain the psychoacoustics and psycho or you can say the psychoacoustics properties of speech perception and speech production. That is not that much of skill oriented things, but yes you should know what is the how the speech is produced and how the speech is perceived. So there is a lot of problem I will solve using the speech perception and speech production. Next one is suppose you know that this is a speech production mechanism that here the speech is produced using the vocal cords and there is a tube."
16.srt,00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:33.250,"So, let us discuss that we have discussed about the speech perception ok. So, this class I will may be it is required two lectures. So, during this two lectures we discuss about the how human being perceive the speech."
16.srt,00:00:33.859 -> 00:01:41.849,"So, if you ask the why we have to know about the human speech perception because if I talk about the digital speech processing then why we require that we should know that digital speech perception the speech perception kind of things. Now if you if you see that human being ultimately we want to copy the human being through a machine or you can say we want to developed an algorithm or technology by which a machine can act as a human being or we can use the speech communication among the human being and that communication we want to establish in machine ok. Now, if I want to do that in speech communication if you see speech production and speech perception. So, two parts speech production human being produce the speech and listeners perceive the speech ok. So, better we understand the how human being perceive the speech. We can better model that we can better process the speech signal that way."
16.srt,00:01:42.819 --> 00:02:09.120,"On the other hand, if I say if I produce a speech and a human listener perceive the speech, how human listener process the speech to perceive it is very important to know. Because unless we do not know what we perceive, the development of technology will be not possible. So, we want to know what kind of speech processing happen in our brain."
16.srt,00:03:10.899 -> 00:03:31.479,"What kind of signal processing involve in the human brain? So, that we want to know that is the speech perception. How we perceive the speech. So, that we want to know that is the speech perception. How we perceive the speech? Forget about this speech chain. So, if you see the auditory systems, we perceive the speech through the auditory systems of the human being."
