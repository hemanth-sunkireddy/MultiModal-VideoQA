4.srt,00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:51.740,"So, this is the LTI systems signals. Fourier transform. Here the time domain signal is discrete, but frequency domain it is continuous."
4.srt,00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:16.159,"Time domain signal is discrete, but frequency domain it is continuous. So, discrete time Fourier transform time domain it is discrete, but here discrete Fourier transform input is discrete and frequency domain also it is represented as a discrete. So, this is a DTFT and DFT."
4.srt,00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:41.500,"So, if I take long signal, I time domain resolution is losing. If I take small signal, frequency resolution is losing. So, this is the limitation of Fourier transform."
4.srt,00:44:58.500 -> 00:45:27.270,"So, x k will be convolved with window function and then multiply with frequency response of the filter. So, this is happening. Details I will discuss when I discuss about the STFT short term frequency short term Fourier transform. Now, if you see the example, example implementation for a time domain signal. Suppose, I want to design a low pass filter cutoff frequency is omega c."
19.srt,00:12:04.689 -> 00:12:21.899,"Now, what What kind of time domain parameters are there? So, I can say short term energy. So, for every window I can find out the short term energy of the speech signal. So, I can say short term energy. So, suppose let us application side you can come."
19.srt,00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:42.220,"So, short time zero crossing can be used to find out whether it is a voice signal or it is a noisy signal. So, short term energy is short term zero crossing can be used. So, the number of zero crossing can be a one parameter to extract the number of zero crossing can be a time domain parameter."
19.srt,00:16:52.980 --> 00:17:22.860,"Then short time autocorrelation I come then short time average magnitude difference those are the parameter I can use from the speech signal and those every parameter has its own purpose also. Now, I just come to that one by one short time energy mathematics. So, energy E of a signal which is n is equal to minus infinity to infinity x of n."
