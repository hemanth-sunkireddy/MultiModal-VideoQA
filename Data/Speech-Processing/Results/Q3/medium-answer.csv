4.srt,00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:51.740,"Here the time domain signal is discrete, but frequency domain it is continuous"
4.srt,00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.120,"Time domain signal is discrete, but frequency domain it is continuous"
4.srt,00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:11.300,"So, discrete time Fourier transform time domain it is discrete, but here discrete Fourier transform input is discrete and frequency domain also it is represented as a discrete"
4.srt,00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:34.009,"So, if I take long signal, I time domain resolution is losing"
4.srt,00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.330,"If I take small signal, frequency resolution is losing"
4.srt,00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.830,Details I will discuss when I discuss about the STFT short term frequency short term Fourier transform
4.srt,00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.210,"Now, if you see the example, example implementation for a time domain signal"
19.srt,00:12:08.359 --> 00:12:10.729,"So, suppose let us application side you can come"
19.srt,00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:30.090,"So, short time zero crossing can be used to find out whether it is a voice signal or it is a noisy signal"
19.srt,00:16:52.980 --> 00:17:06.340,Then short time autocorrelation I come then short time average magnitude difference those are the parameter I can use from the speech signal and those every parameter has its own purpose also
19.srt,00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:14.870,"Now, I just come to that one by one short time energy mathematics"
19.srt,00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:22.860,"So, energy E of a signal which is n is equal to minus infinity to infinity x of n"
