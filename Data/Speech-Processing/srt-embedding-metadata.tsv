8.srt	00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:24.500	So, last class I have taken about that manner and place of articulation.
8.srt	00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.089	I have described what is manner and what is place of articulation based on the manner and based on the plate of place of articulation.
8.srt	00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.939	The IPS symbols we have discussed and we assign an IPS symbols.
8.srt	00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.189	So and we said that the vowels all the vowels are classified based on the tongue position and tongue height.
8.srt	00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.899	So, F 1, F 2 and F 3 their relationship I have discussed.
8.srt	00:00:46.439 --> 00:01:02.789	Now today instead of taking a lectures today I give you some demonstration to see the voice sound and identify the manner and place of articulation we cannot identify by viewing that that sample.
8.srt	00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:13.319	But yes, we can identify the manner of articulation and from there we can see what kind of concern and it is what kind of how the formants are moving or kind of things.
8.srt	00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.730	So those will be explained.
8.srt	00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.400	So if you see there is a number of open source software available the cool edit, then I have web surfer.
8.srt	00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:30.879	So I have explained in one slide that lot of open source that speech processing software are available.
8.srt	00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:33.120	Now one of them are the cool edit.
8.srt	00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:55.340	If you see the cool edit software that is also downloadable from the cool edit pro is downloadable from the net and then if you see that any when you open a voice let us I have recorded that this let us I give you an example let us go through that this is an example of a voice which is recorded for a English speech.
8.srt	00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.239	Let us see the listen that voice.
8.srt	00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:27.889	So, this is the voice which is recorded by a English speaker English speech some sentence Now if you see that this x axis which is written the sample number of sample as we discuss in signal processing that once you recorded the digital speech that this is x axis is sample number of sample or it can be time or sample then y axis is the amplitude if you see this the amplitude.
8.srt	00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:38.339	Now if you see this portion no speech that amplitude of the samples are very low almost close to zero line this is zero zero amplitude line.
8.srt	00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:44.689	So, zero line if you see this is recorded with forty four kilohertz sixteen bit mono.
8.srt	00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.930	So each sample is you can say that it is quantized using the sixteen bit.
8.srt	00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.340	So some value of the sixteen bit is there based on that value it is y axis is that value.
8.srt	00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:06.939	So it is a this is zero axis zero axis this is minus this is plus and samples are all samples are flawed and this is look like a sample speech signal.
8.srt	00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.949	If you see this see this portion.
8.srt	00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.400	is the silence portion.
8.srt	00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.550	And here there is a voice portion, there is a noise portion, noisy kind of signal.
8.srt	00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:18.479	I can magnify it.
8.srt	00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.310	So, if you see that this is noise kind of things.
8.srt	00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.990	If you listen it also, some noise signals are there.
8.srt	00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.020	Now if I see that this is a time domain representation of the speech signal.
8.srt	00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.610	Now there is another kind of representation which is called spectral view.
8.srt	00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:42.860	Look like a, you can see this is look like a mostly x-ray plate kind of things.
8.srt	00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.459	So, here what is there it is called three dimensional plot of the speech signal.
8.srt	00:03:48.889 --> 00:04:02.519	What it is done if you are not a signal processing background then broadly you can think about like this that suppose I want to know that frequency analysis of the signal.
8.srt	00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:15.469	So, I have a time domain speech signal S n which I plot time versus sample value sample value or amplitude now I want to plot.
8.srt	00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.709	What are the frequency content in this signal?
8.srt	00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:30.389	So I say my y axis is the frequency, my x axis is the let us x axis is the frequency and I want to know the each frequency content amplitude.
8.srt	00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.939	So then the power of every single frequency.
8.srt	00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.439	So this is a two dimensional plot frequency versus power.
8.srt	00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:43.629	This is also time versus sample amplitude.
8.srt	00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.319	Now the problem is that if I plot this way.
8.srt	00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.379	Then I do not know the time information.
8.srt	00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.859	I want the time information should be there.
8.srt	00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.099	So what I do?
8.srt	00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:54.870	I do a spectrographic plot.
8.srt	00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.279	How do I do it?
8.srt	00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.370	I will discuss in the signal processing class.
8.srt	00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:15.929	So in x axis, let us this is time or sample and y axis is the frequency okay and then the amplitude or power of the particular frequency is represented by a color.
8.srt	00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:18.669	It may be a color or it may be a black and white.
8.srt	00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.729	So black means the power is high, white means there is no power in this case.
8.srt	00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:30.219	In this case black means power is high, white means there is no power.
8.srt	00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:35.769	So I am not going details about the how the spectrogram is made that I will discuss in the signal processing class.
8.srt	00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:46.349	So if you see in this picture some portion are very dark those contain the high frequency power of those portion are very high.
8.srt	00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.239	So if I see this y axis is the frequency axis if you see.
8.srt	00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:51.779	There is a frequency axis.
8.srt	00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.689	So, this is 2 kilo Hertz, 4 kilo Hertz, 6 kilo Hertz, 8 kilo Hertz.
8.srt	00:05:58.109 --> 00:06:00.429	So, sampling frequency is 44 kilo Hertz.
8.srt	00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:06.349	So, up to 20 kilo Hertz it is there, 22 kilo Hertz, f s by 2.
8.srt	00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:11.489	Now, if you see the black portion are contain the high power.
8.srt	00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:16.189	So, if I say within 2 kilo Hertz most of the sections are black.
8.srt	00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.799	So, that contain the high power.
8.srt	00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.769	Now, if it is noise kind of sound if you listen it.
8.srt	00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.839	It is a noise kind of sound.
8.srt	00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:34.129	So if this is noise kind of sound, then you see the power distribution of the all frequency are present.
8.srt	00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:42.909	So there may be some dark portion are there, some light portion are there, but more or less there is all powers are there.
8.srt	00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:48.289	So I can say that if the random noise, the all frequency has some power.
8.srt	00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:49.879	So this is random noise.
8.srt	00:06:56.179 --> 00:07:02.919	So if I say who generates the random noise, what kind of manner of articulation, what kind generated those kind of random noise if I say fricative or if I say aspiration.
8.srt	00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:07.179	So if it is fricative that means friction noise will be there.
8.srt	00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:11.049	So I can easily say this is nothing but a fricative.
8.srt	00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:19.739	Now if I see here there is no power at all in the frequency.
8.srt	00:07:19.799 --> 00:07:22.009	If you see there is no power at all.
8.srt	00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:24.689	So if you see the time domain this is zero sample level.
8.srt	00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:27.219	So that means this portion is silence.
8.srt	00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:37.829	So, this portion is silence, this portion is fricative, if I say it I can zoom out this is fricative, this portion is voiced.
8.srt	00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:52.459	So it may contain voice consonant, it may contain vocalic sound, vowel, it may contain diphthong, it may contain semi vowel, I do not know, but it contains some vocalic sound.
8.srt	00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:54.059	So, vocalic sound look like this.
8.srt	00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:59.259	Again if I say showing this spectrogram I ask you.
8.srt	00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:07.999	just spot out that fricative sound easily I can say this was in fricative sound, this was in fricative sound.
8.srt	00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:23.279	I can say find out the vocalic region, I can say here to here is the one vocalic region, here to here is the one vocalic region, here to here is another vocalic region.
8.srt	00:08:30.799 --> 00:08:34.289	Now if you see interestingly in here if you go to the time domain, if you see there is a and there is a burst kind of noise is there.
8.srt	00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:38.809	If you see there is a burst kind of things.
8.srt	00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:46.389	If I go to the spectrogram, see no voicing then burst then aspiration then voicing.
8.srt	00:08:46.849 --> 00:08:50.500	So I can say here there is either a plosive consonant is there.
8.srt	00:08:50.500 --> 00:09:04.809	I do not know which plosive it is but I can say it is a consonant which is plosive kind of nature because there is a burst and there is a if I say this is non-aspirated because there is no aspiration in here.
8.srt	00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:11.969	There is a lot of noise is there that is why upside frequency are present.
8.srt	00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:17.669	So, if I forgot the noise, if I consider only this portion is a silence portion.
8.srt	00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.609	Let us try do the noise removal.
8.srt	00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:24.029	There is this tool has provided the facility that I can remove the noise.
8.srt	00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:26.429	So, there may be a 50 hertz noise in here.
8.srt	00:09:26.719 --> 00:09:31.509	So, what I will do there is a provision for noise reduction analyze.
8.srt	00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.789	Let us transform noise reduction the subtraction noise reduction I am not going details, but it is there.
8.srt	00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.240	So I can say the select the first silence portion, I can say this portion is noise portion.
8.srt	00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:55.029	So I can transform noise reduction, noise reduction then I can say get profile because this portion this is not sufficient to get the profile.
8.srt	00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:59.090	So I can FFT size I can reduce and then also it is not sufficient.
8.srt	00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:06.569	So what I will do I will select much more whatever is possible then find try to find out noise reduction.
8.srt	00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.570	then also I have to reduce it to then just this one not possible.
8.srt	00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:22.409	So, this one is possible gate profile I get the noise profile then I close it then I control a select all then transform noise reduction.
8.srt	00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:35.830	So, what it will do whole signal the signal is very long that is why it will take time whole signal noise will be subtracted as per the sample noise I have given to the system.
8.srt	00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:40.759	So, there is lot details are there signal processing details are there I am not going that.
8.srt	00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.879	that much of detail.
8.srt	00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:45.959	Since the signal is noisy that is why I am just cleaning the signal first.
8.srt	00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:49.309	Then I show you how the co is like that.
8.srt	00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.149	What is the occlusion?
8.srt	00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:53.429	What is burst?
8.srt	00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:57.179	If you see now, if you see this portion, noise is reduced.
8.srt	00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.139	Almost noise is reduced.
8.srt	00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:01.579	So if I see almost noise is gone.
8.srt	00:11:02.809 --> 00:11:04.539	Now if I see, listen it.
8.srt	00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:05.449	Now it is clear.
8.srt	00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:19.430	Now if you see, so he pronounced So, ka followed by a vowel, again ka followed by a vowel, again ka followed by a vowel.
8.srt	00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:34.620	So I can say if I zoom this portion only, so I can say if you see this is the if you see just little bit of unzoom, if you see this portion to this portion, this portion is transitory part.
8.srt	00:11:34.909 --> 00:11:36.399	So this is steady state vowel part.
8.srt	00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:44.360	If I show you, so this black color is gradually increasing and here if you see that almost steady.
8.srt	00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:50.389	Then again if you see this is just follow the mouse again start breaking.
8.srt	00:11:50.620 --> 00:12:03.740	So I can say this portion is nothing but a transitory portion when the vocal when we want to pronounce after the vowel we want to pronounce again ka.
8.srt	00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:09.740	So this is the transitory portion transitory between vowels and consonant.
8.srt	00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.879	So if I say I am in here vowel I want to produce a consonant then there will be a vowel to consonant transition.
8.srt	00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:27.720	That means that articulator is producing vowel let us a, ca, then it want to produce vowel co.
8.srt	00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:28.610	So what is the effect?
8.srt	00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.370	The vocal chord has to be open and the articulator has to be closed.
8.srt	00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.029	So vocal chord opening is not started but articulator is moving to close to produce the co.
8.srt	00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:46.240	So once the articulator moving to close the air flow is reduced the sound in the if you see the formant structure is changing.
8.srt	00:12:46.539 --> 00:12:49.299	from seduced vowel to consonant.
8.srt	00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:57.990	Then if you see after here no noise, no signal, if you see there is no signal almost silence.
8.srt	00:12:58.929 --> 00:13:02.329	So this part I can say occlusion part.
8.srt	00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:09.120	Then if you see there is a burst, here there is a burst, there is a burst.
8.srt	00:13:09.599 --> 00:13:10.729	So burst is happened.
8.srt	00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:13.959	Then there is a beauty.
8.srt	00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.379	If you see voice on set time, voice on set time is very less.
8.srt	00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:26.490	If you see here, if I zoom it and then I show you, if you see the after blast vowels are not yet started.
8.srt	00:13:26.769 --> 00:13:31.019	So there is a delay between the vocal cord vibration and articulatory opening.
8.srt	00:13:31.309 --> 00:13:36.250	So what is done, this portion there is no signal, then the signal is started.
8.srt	00:13:36.529 --> 00:13:41.179	Then what is happening, again it want to produce co to a.
8.srt	00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.500	So again articulator has to be go to position of a.
8.srt	00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:48.139	So there is a tangitary movement to reach the steady state.
8.srt	00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.549	So I can say.
8.srt	00:13:50.009 --> 00:13:55.819	is a V ot then again there will be a consonant to vowel transition.
8.srt	00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:22.469	So now if I see I can recognize if I give you a signal you can say this portion is nothing but a transitory portion, this portion is nothing but a occlusion, this is the burst then this is a V ot and then this is again consonant to vowel transition again steady strain vowel if you look the wave flow of the steady strain vowel.
8.srt	00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:26.210	almost all wall period are same.
8.srt	00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.860	So, I can say a two peak is period.
8.srt	00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:44.200	So, I can say this to this is period, this to this is a period or I can say here to here may be a period, here may be a period.
8.srt	00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:49.330	So, I can say almost all wall period are same.
8.srt	00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.740	Now, if I see the transitory portion, if you see the structure is not yet.
8.srt	00:14:54.259 --> 00:15:00.379	So, I can say here to here is nothing but a consonant to vowel transition.
8.srt	00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:04.689	That part vowels is steady state part called vowel steady state.
8.srt	00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:09.319	Then again it will start from steady state to consonant transition.
8.srt	00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:25.039	So, by seeing a waveform or by seeing a spectrogram, if you see the formant structure, I am not showing you the formant because this time I am not introducing the formant here to see the formant in spectrogram.
8.srt	00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.339	Later on I can show you.
8.srt	00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:46.590	If you see, if it is now if you see this portion, if it is if you see again consonant to vowel transition occlusion period burst, then if you see aspirated VOT, so long VOT.
8.srt	00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:56.399	If you see compared to O, the long VOT which is totally aspirated, noise like of sound, aspiration is there, noise kind of aspiration is there.
8.srt	00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:03.240	sorry, VOT is unaspirated and in case of kh, VOT is aspirated.
8.srt	00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:20.909	By seeing I can say, so I can say I do not know if I not listen the sound I cannot say whether it is a kh or kh, but I can seeing the spectrogram I can say at least I can say this is a some aspiration flacid consonant.
8.srt	00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:41.490	I seeing the spectrogram I can say this is a unaspirated I do not know the place of particulation because place of particulation if I want to know then I have to know how the tongue is moving because the difference between the ka and toh, what is the difference?
8.srt	00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:51.029	Toh is bilabial dental plosive, toh is dental plosive and ko is velar dental plosive.
8.srt	00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:08.710	So if I say ka ka ka ka and ta ta ta ta only difference is that Tongue movement from A to TA and TA to A is different from KA to A and KA to A to KO.
8.srt	00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:16.809	So it is one is the velar opening, velar closure, another is the tip of the tongue touches the tip to produce the TO.
8.srt	00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.099	So cavity structure will be different that time.
8.srt	00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:27.730	So seeing the spectrogram I can at least say what kind of manner of that consonant.
8.srt	00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:28.769	So this is KO.
8.srt	00:17:29.009 --> 00:17:34.210	Again I can go little detail then if you see this is ga, let us see the ga.
8.srt	00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:50.539	So ga is nothing in Hindi ga, Bengali ga or ga is ga, ga is whether it is English, Hindi, Bengali, ga is voiced unaspirated flossing.
8.srt	00:17:50.859 --> 00:17:54.970	So if you see the voice that means there will be a voicing during the occlusion.
8.srt	00:17:55.369 --> 00:17:58.029	So if you see the occlusion period there is a voicing.
8.srt	00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:01.299	So I can say.
8.srt	00:18:01.609 --> 00:18:06.359	Now, since the voicing is there, then it is voiced.
8.srt	00:18:07.069 --> 00:18:12.279	If you see there is a burst is also there, there is a burst, then V ot is less.
8.srt	00:18:12.729 --> 00:18:19.649	If you see the gha, let us I show you the gha, again if it is gha, if you see the aspiration will be there.
8.srt	00:18:21.459 --> 00:18:27.529	Again V ot occlusion period is voiced, burst is there and then you see the aspiration is voiced.
8.srt	00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:31.309	So, this pronunciation is a voiced.
8.srt	00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:39.089	Then if I say I do not know this is may be cha, I think it is cha.
8.srt	00:18:39.089 --> 00:18:54.309	So if it is cha then if you see occlusion, friction, then vort, very little vort then if you see occlusion, friction, occlusion, friction.
8.srt	00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:56.159	Now if I show you.
8.srt	00:19:02.569 --> 00:19:04.709	Let us come to the cha.
8.srt	00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:11.059	Only difference is that if you cha is if you see applicate.
8.srt	00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:21.119	So if you see cha, the aspiration, this is the aspiration part, this is the friction part and then followed by an aspiration is also there.
8.srt	00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:22.449	So cha cha.
8.srt	00:19:22.819 --> 00:19:27.529	Now if you see the ja, what is the difference?
8.srt	00:19:28.439 --> 00:19:32.449	This is the occlusion part should be instead of unversed.
8.srt	00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:37.049	it is voiced and then there is aspiration.
8.srt	00:19:38.309 --> 00:19:39.249	Understand.
8.srt	00:19:41.499 --> 00:19:54.159	So, cha cha then ja ja.
8.srt	00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:56.039	So, cha cha ja ja.
8.srt	00:19:56.369 --> 00:20:04.549	So, place of articulation I cannot say, but seeing the spectrogram from the manner of articulation.
8.srt	00:20:04.749 --> 00:20:07.239	I can say what kind of consonant it is.
8.srt	00:20:08.049 --> 00:20:26.309	If you see the retroflex, I do not know why the retroflex is this may be then that may be I think so if it is I do not know it may be Tau.
8.srt	00:20:27.079 --> 00:20:27.549	So, Tau.
8.srt	00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:31.659	So, see that again there is a vast unversed occlusion.
8.srt	00:20:31.659 --> 00:20:36.059	So, I seeing this spectrum waveform I cannot say whether it is a Tau or not.
8.srt	00:20:36.249 --> 00:20:46.419	whether it is a to whether it is a co but I can say yes it is a unvoiced unaspirated flossing okay.
8.srt	00:20:46.479 --> 00:20:48.259	So at least manner I can say.
8.srt	00:20:48.469 --> 00:21:04.139	So if you look like the record your different kind of consonant with vowel and look like what kind of it is look so you can see the look but if you closely watch the spectrogram then you find in case of retroflex the formant movement that will be a formant structure.
8.srt	00:21:04.629 --> 00:21:10.539	Here I cannot show you but in part it is possible to draw the formant also if you see the formant movement will be different.
8.srt	00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:29.399	So a consonant whether it is ko, whether it is to, whether it is to, whether it is po is only differentiate by the transitory movement from consonant to vowel or vowel to consonant.
8.srt	00:21:30.829 --> 00:21:42.029	So if I say the difference between the ka ka ka ka and ta ta ta only lies between the vowel to consonant transition.
8.srt	00:21:42.499 --> 00:21:56.039	and consonant to vowel transitory part where since the movement of the tongue is different that is why transition movement of the transition will be different frequency movement in the transition will be different.
8.srt	00:21:56.779 --> 00:22:06.819	So we only rely I have to rely on this thing to find out whether it is a ko whether it is a to whether it is a to whether it is a po.
8.srt	00:22:07.239 --> 00:22:13.909	So if I have a lot of confusion may be happen in signal parsing between this group.
8.srt	00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:21.389	And co is difference by the co is by only aspiration.
8.srt	00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:30.269	So if I able to find out the aspiration then I can say yes I can differentiate between the co and co because elsewhere there is no signal.
8.srt	00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:33.479	Occlusion is silence.
8.srt	00:22:34.759 --> 00:22:44.619	So seeing the manner you can learn what kind of signal processing I should use for what kind of application.
8.srt	00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:51.329	then you have to know what kind of signal I am getting and what are that phonemes it how it is behave.
8.srt	00:22:51.599 --> 00:23:09.839	So, I cannot say the result consonant recognition result of English and consonant recognition result of Bengali may be different because Bengali has more more number of stop consonant compared to the English stop and plosive even Hindi has more number of stop consonant compared to the English.
8.srt	00:23:10.489 --> 00:23:23.629	So, identifying the voice consonant is easy because voice there is a some signals are there some frequency composition is there, but if you see the difference between the co, to, to, po is only the transitory part.
8.srt	00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:26.909	If this portion is silence, there is a bask, there is a beauty.
8.srt	00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:31.869	And difference between the ko and kha is rely only on aspiration.
8.srt	00:23:34.349 --> 00:23:41.939	So I, this is very, very, if I want to find out the high accuracy, I may not get it between the ko and kha.
8.srt	00:23:41.939 --> 00:23:46.189	So that now there is a another aspect is the ko articulatory effect.
8.srt	00:23:46.389 --> 00:23:50.839	I am not showing you this is the nonsense pronouncing the ka, ka, ka, ka, ka, ka, ka, ka, ka.
8.srt	00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:54.099	This is very means very well.
8.srt	00:23:54.449 --> 00:24:09.919	behave but if it is continuous pronunciation, if you see I can show you in Bengali example, if I say I show you Bengali example that continuous things let us say Bangladesh one.
8.srt	00:24:11.569 --> 00:24:18.669	So if you see that the speak is continuous so it may be a.
8.srt	00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:25.959	So in words when I write if I write a.
8.srt	00:25:02.939 --> 00:25:06.039	or so there is a two words of there but if you say the continuous speech there is a no word boundary is there only continuous speech so that may be a vowel that may be a that may be a if i say this is what kind of consonant again it may be a because occlusion period is voice there is a and there is a transition i do not know which kind of vowel it is then i have to listen it i can see it ok then i can say this may be a because it is a fiction.
8.srt	00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:35.999	So, Bengali has a only only pronounce the so is there palatal so in mostly cases we pronounce the palatal so so it may be palatal so so so it is a so so there is a if you see there is a no word boundary if a if a there is a no gap between the two words when you say in a continuous but when you write it there is a gap in a words if I show you English example.
8.srt	00:25:43.889 --> 00:25:49.339	If you see there is a no gap, I can give you the number all you can understand.
8.srt	00:25:49.889 --> 00:25:50.829	So, if I show you number.
8.srt	00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:55.739	75461297 All in the number.
8.srt	00:25:55.739 --> 00:26:03.879	75461297 Now, I can ask you based on the manner and seeing the spectrogram can you identify the number.
8.srt	00:26:07.449 --> 00:26:22.279	So, this kind of problem people may ask you that let us do the signal processing later on find out the speech processing later on, but seeing the number if I say find out what should be the number this one and what should be the number this one.
8.srt	00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:25.929	So, if it is a 7 it should be start by a friction.
8.srt	00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:30.299	If it is a 7 then it should be start by a friction.
8.srt	00:26:30.859 --> 00:26:35.939	So that way I have to find out whether there is number words are different or not.
8.srt	00:26:36.619 --> 00:26:36.909	Okay.
8.srt	00:26:37.319 --> 00:26:43.389	Now one thing I can again show you, let us see this speech.
8.srt	00:26:45.159 --> 00:27:08.579	Now when you learn, when you heard it, you cannot find out, if you do not know the Japanese, you do not know what it is spoken or you cannot recognize the words, sentence, all kind of things, but if you heard the basic sound, you can understand the basic sound.
8.srt	00:27:11.139 --> 00:27:35.219	So, I can say that some language, so that is why I have said that to decipher the language is important to find out the sequence of phonemes to produce a meaningful pronunciation.
8.srt	00:27:37.129 --> 00:27:39.259	So, all the sounds are there.
8.srt	00:27:39.629 --> 00:27:41.369	All basic sounds will be same.
8.srt	00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:43.039	You can also see it.
8.srt	00:27:43.249 --> 00:27:45.139	I will share this all sound file.
8.srt	00:27:45.139 --> 00:27:45.759	You can see it.
8.srt	00:27:46.069 --> 00:27:50.579	All the basic sounds, if you see there is a maybe a ta, there may be a mo, there may be a no.
8.srt	00:27:50.819 --> 00:27:52.979	All kinds of sounds are there.
8.srt	00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:58.439	But if you see, once I play it, I cannot recognize it because I don't know the language.
8.srt	00:27:59.659 --> 00:28:01.189	But sound structure is same.
8.srt	00:28:01.499 --> 00:28:11.279	That's why we say IPA, International Phonetic Alphabet, which alphabet represent the sound only.
8.srt	00:28:11.319 --> 00:28:12.929	It does not depend on the language.
8.srt	00:28:14.049 --> 00:28:26.689	So, co may exist in Bengali, co may exist in Hindi, co may exist in Tamil, that sound may exist in Malayalam, that may exist in Japanese, that may exist in Chinese, that can exist in German also.
8.srt	00:28:28.019 --> 00:28:34.269	So phonemes are the sound, sequence of phoneme produce the message.
8.srt	00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:39.199	Now production of phoneme involve this part.
8.srt	00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:51.009	So there is problem, that problem is that some phoneme may be exist in Bangla but it may not be exist in Hindi or it may not be exist in English.
8.srt	00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:55.969	Some phoneme which is exist in English but not in Bengali.
8.srt	00:28:56.459 --> 00:28:57.309	So what is happen?
8.srt	00:28:57.629 --> 00:29:14.629	Suppose I produce the English, the speech which I produce in English language, sequence of sound is such a way that it follow the English language grammar but what happening is that my English cannot be say it is the British English, how the British is pronounced.
8.srt	00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:20.529	Because in case of British English, my mother tongue is first language is Bengali.
8.srt	00:29:20.719 --> 00:29:23.809	So, I learn that Bengali phoneme production.
8.srt	00:29:24.089 --> 00:29:28.579	When I learn English, I try to copy that production with the English language.
8.srt	00:29:28.749 --> 00:29:30.859	So, that is called L1 L2 acquisition.
8.srt	00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:32.659	So, details I am not discussing.
8.srt	00:29:32.939 --> 00:29:35.079	Details are there.
8.srt	00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:40.669	So, there is another part also, segmental, suprasegmental that part I will come later on.
8.srt	00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:44.599	So, what I was saying it is a segmental property that in a segment.
8.srt	00:30:17.659 --> 00:30:26.459	what is the look like this so this is called segmental property ok so i request all of you to find out to records or to analyze one number of speech signal see it in spectrogram or time domain try to find out manner of articulation of that production if you see there is a vowel transitory effect also there if i say i have a bengali sound i think i have i will show you So, if you see there is a word, one word is end and another word is begin, but there is no gap.
8.srt	00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:32.699	It is a co-articulate, it likes a complete single word.
8.srt	00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:36.009	So, that details I will come later on that.
8.srt	00:30:36.009 --> 00:30:43.679	So, there is no gap, main thing is that there is no word boundary which is define SP signal.
8.srt	00:30:46.969 --> 00:30:48.709	in a there is no silence.
8.srt	00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:54.209	I cannot say that this word is defined by this word if there is a gap in certain things.
8.srt	00:30:54.429 --> 00:30:55.839	So, there may be a silence in speech.
8.srt	00:30:55.839 --> 00:30:56.089	No.
8.srt	00:30:57.469 --> 00:31:00.769	All words are related to each other with a co-articulated effect.
8.srt	00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:02.579	Then there is a prosody will come.
8.srt	00:31:02.579 --> 00:31:05.059	Then the silence will come based on the prosodic structure.
8.srt	00:31:05.059 --> 00:31:06.679	So, I am not coming that part.
8.srt	00:31:06.679 --> 00:31:16.409	Then I can say the phonemes are have a co-articulated effect followed by a so there is a co, then a co-art transition, then a to.
8.srt	00:31:17.479 --> 00:31:20.949	the O transition, so all kind of transitory movement will be there.
8.srt	00:31:22.039 --> 00:31:34.019	Now if you see there will be exist some combination which cannot produce by me or which cannot produce, which cannot producible, so that combination will not exist in that language.
8.srt	00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:45.859	So if you see there will be no, you cannot find a case where there will be two aspirated sound will be clubbed together that is not producible.
8.srt	00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:49.219	So if it is two aspirated.
8.srt	00:31:49.499 --> 00:31:55.829	then one will be unaspirated, one will be aspirated.
8.srt	00:31:56.089 --> 00:32:07.119	So, depending on the how tongue movement restriction some combination of the phoneme set does not exist in for a particular language or that is not valid.
8.srt	00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:09.439	So, those kind of things also you learn.
8.srt	00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:16.219	So, then there is a called phonology that the written words not proper with the pronunciation words.
8.srt	00:32:16.219 --> 00:32:20.759	So, that part I will discuss in the TTS when I talk about the TTS phonology.
8.srt	00:32:21.209 --> 00:32:25.059	that word to phoneme conversion.
8.srt	00:32:25.429 --> 00:32:38.339	So now I will request all of you to record the sounds and listen that sounds and find out what kind of consonant it is then you can say you can expertise your skill.
8.srt	00:32:38.689 --> 00:32:45.639	I said one of the outcome of this course is that for a given signal you should able to level the signals.
8.srt	00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:48.919	So for that skill development you should practice it.
8.srt	00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:52.769	Let us look this kind of example I sometime given.
8.srt	00:32:54.199 --> 00:33:16.989	that sometime I have given that some I will give you some spectrogram and some words let us I say char or I can say that 1 1 2 let us 7 3 words I have given.
8.srt	00:33:18.709 --> 00:33:24.439	Now if I give the spectrogram of the 3 words and told you identify which is 1 which is 2 which is 7.
8.srt	00:33:26.709 --> 00:33:33.549	Now, if you see all three are vocalic, this one is nasal murmur, two vowel.
8.srt	00:33:33.959 --> 00:33:40.819	If you see here starting is a stop consonant or plasmid, then there is a two vocalic two.
8.srt	00:33:41.929 --> 00:33:52.879	Then if you hear there is a fricative sound in here, then there is also nasal murmur ending and the say then there will be a voiced consonant here.
8.srt	00:33:55.699 --> 00:33:59.499	So I can say seeing this is is fricative then I can say it is silent.
8.srt	00:33:59.499 --> 00:34:09.729	First one is plosive 2, first one is vocalic 1 that kind of things I can ask you.
8.srt	00:34:10.459 --> 00:34:19.339	Another thing is that I have just closed it again I open it if you see that I can show you how to see the pitch fundamental frequency let us see here.
8.srt	00:34:20.169 --> 00:34:27.669	So this is the vocalic region details signal processing I will discuss if you analyze the frequency if you see that.
8.srt	00:34:28.379 --> 00:34:29.599	This is frequency analysis.
8.srt	00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:35.349	So, I say instead of linear view, I can make it log view.
8.srt	00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:42.969	Now, if you see this is the frequency representation and this is the dB in power, power of the particular frequency.
8.srt	00:34:43.439 --> 00:34:52.379	Now, if you see this, let us scan it with little bit of high things.
8.srt	00:34:54.529 --> 00:34:55.889	So, if you see this is the fast peak.
8.srt	00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.780	So, fast peak may be frequency is called fundamental frequency.
8.srt	00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:14.369	So, I will discuss the finding out the fundamental frequency of a signal those methodology I will discuss why this is the one of the methodology to see the fundamental frequency.
8.srt	00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:21.030	Now, I can move this cursor to here and I can see this scan again fundamentalism may be changed.
8.srt	00:35:22.389 --> 00:35:24.139	So, the movement of fundamental frequency will be there.
8.srt	00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:28.869	So, that I will discuss later on let us not do it, but you should practice.
8.srt	00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.389	those things visualize different consonant find out i can say you the level the occlusion period level the bass level the v o t level the steady state portion of the vowels then level a diphthong then level a vowel vowel combination so those things are there in the slides and once you practice it you can able to relate it if you say that or if you can give the feedback that ok you have some difficulties then i will again take a tutorial to show you those kind of consonant and those kind of vowel combination.
8.srt	00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:02.210	Thank you.
9.srt	00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:27.789	So, let us the in the first weeks we have study about that space of articulation speech acoustics and overview of signal processing.
9.srt	00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.329	Let us start the new topics that uniform tube modeling of speech production.
9.srt	00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:48.409	That what is the purpose of that whole course for speech processing is that we should know how the human speech is produced ok. After knowing that can I able to mathematically model that human speech production that is our motto.
9.srt	00:00:48.780 --> 00:01:00.530	If I know the mathematical model is speech production system then studying the system property ah we can know what kind of speech property we should look for in the acoustic signal ok.
9.srt	00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:05.569	So, our motto is to developed a mathematical model.
9.srt	00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:08.000	of human speech production systems.
9.srt	00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:31.219	Now, if you see that we have said that this human speech production system has a two part, one is the gaudal vibration that glottis the source of vibration and that sound or vibration pass through the vocal cavity or you can that oral cavity and nasal cavity and produce the different kind of sound depending on the tube structure or the cavity structure.
9.srt	00:01:39.060 --> 00:02:03.210	Now, we want to develop if the glottis is produced sound, How can I model this tube model so that I can say I can if I able to design the mathematical model of the human vocal cord system then I changing the parameters I can produce the speech or what I know that if I know the exact model or approximate model of the human speech production system I know the model property.
9.srt	00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:16.110	So, I deriving the model property I can understand what kind of signal processing I should apply on human speech so that I can know exactly what is happening in here.
9.srt	00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:27.700	Now, if I want to model it, the complexity is that human speech production model is not a simple single tube.
9.srt	00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:45.670	If I have a, if you see in high secondary also you have studied that there is a single tube, if this end is closed and a sound is generated here, you know what kind of frequency you accept, what kind of sound you expect from the sound that depends on the length of the tube.
9.srt	00:02:48.120 --> 00:03:01.240	In human vocal tract the this area of the tube in here it is fixed for a rigid tube, but human this area is not same throughout the tube.
9.srt	00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:18.030	So, that area may be look like this sorry area may be this is the upper cavity let us lips then started this is the upper cavity which is almost fixed and if you see the lower cavity the tongue of the tip and then back tongue of the tip and like this way.
9.srt	00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:28.639	Now, if you see depending on the different sound production system, the structure, the cross-sectional area of the different portion of the cavity for different sound is different.
9.srt	00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.810	So, you can say there is two kind of variation.
9.srt	00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.379	While I produce the speech, speech signal is changing along the time.
9.srt	00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:44.079	That means the constriction of the tube or structure of the tube is changing along the time.
9.srt	00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.579	And also for a particular time, let us produce for this time t1.
9.srt	00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.319	that the structure the tube the cross sectional area of the tube in all section is not same.
9.srt	00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.219	So, two complexity one is that cross sectional area of the tube is not equal in every length.
9.srt	00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:18.009	So, if I say this is the glottis or this is the vocal cords this is the x equal to 0 and this is at the lip if you see this is the if this is the lip or if the dental and then there is a lip if I say there is a lip.
9.srt	00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.389	So, and at lip let us x equal to 0.
9.srt	00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:32.860	L. So, length of the tube is L, but throughout the length here cross sectional area is same if it is A and here it is also A.
9.srt	00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:41.170	Now, in here it is different, here it is different, here it is different, let us here it is different, here it is different, here it is different.
9.srt	00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:44.449	So, different kind of cross sectional area is there.
9.srt	00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.160	Now, once I produce co maybe the back of the tongue touches the upper cavity.
9.srt	00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:58.209	When I produce paw lip lip is touches close together main cavity structure will be different.
9.srt	00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:08.750	So, I can say for different sound or when you continuously produce the different kind of sound the cavity structures is changing with respect to time also.
9.srt	00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:22.709	Now, we could not consider the let us we considering that at for a particular sound with fixed cavity structure is there that is ok. Another simplification we done.
9.srt	00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:35.110	Let us think the whole human vocal system is nothing but a single cavity, single tube or single tube whose cross sectional area is fixed A.
9.srt	00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:52.150	So, I say throughout the glottis or vocal cords to mouth throughout the whole system the cavity is uniform or given the tube is uniform and it has a cross sectional area A.
9.srt	00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.160	So, this is called uniform tube.
9.srt	00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:23.540	Now, let us I consider it is uniform then we say cross sectional area is A even it is uniform then also the walls of the cavity is not rigid this walls are not rigid if it is not rigid then if the air pressure increases the area cross sectional area may change.
9.srt	00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.240	So, this is less vocal chord.
9.srt	00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:45.759	x equal to 0 and this is lip side x equal to L. So, if I if the if the walls are not rigid if this tube is not rigid wall then when the air pressure is passing through the tube walls will be the cross sectional area of the tube will be changed because wall will be deformed.
9.srt	00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:53.240	Now, neglect that part also they do not consider that part.
9.srt	00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.970	So, I am not considering we said neglect that part let us the wall consider walls are rigid.
9.srt	00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:10.490	Next one is that there may be a thermal loss, there may be a viscous loss, there may be a friction loss, let us consider that loss also not there.
9.srt	00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:29.250	So, we simplify that human vocal track is nothing but a single tube whose cross sectional area is constant A, there is a no friction loss, there is a no viscous loss, there is a no thermal conduction.
9.srt	00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:37.400	then try to derive the equation of this human vocal track.
9.srt	00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.660	So, uniform tube model.
9.srt	00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.689	So, how do we derive that vocal track equation?
9.srt	00:07:43.020 --> 00:08:01.290	So, if it is a system, if you studied that electrical system signals and system, if I have a system, if I apply a input, let input is x n, this I consider x n and output is y n, then transfer function if it is h n.
9.srt	00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:34.649	h n then we say h n is nothing but a y n divided by x n. So, we know how the sound is propagated input sound in here which is input is provided by the glottis or vocal cords after vibrating it inject the particle velocity and that particle particles will propagated along here and radiated from the mouth radiated from the mouth.
9.srt	00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:45.709	So, I have to know how the wave is sound wave is propagated along this tube, along this tube.
9.srt	00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:52.259	Now, you have studied already studied that wave equation you know the wave propagation equation.
9.srt	00:08:52.679 --> 00:09:00.029	So, what is tell that if I produce a sound can I mathematically express the.
9.srt	00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:07.769	So, if I produce a sound, sound is propagated in the medium with a condensation and relaxation condensation and relaxation wave.
9.srt	00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:40.699	can I develop a mathematical equation how that pressure wave is propagated from one point to another point that is the wave equation ok. Now considering that amplitude of the pressure if I say the wave is propagated linearly then we say linear wave equation here I am saying the amplitude of the sound is not that enough that propagation become non-linear.
9.srt	00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:51.899	So, I said amplitude is less with the limit within the limit and sound is propagated linearly in the medium and medium is also homogeneous.
9.srt	00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:56.730	Then we can derive the linear wave equation.
9.srt	00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:06.740	Similarly, here also we try to derive the linear wave equation, how the wave is propagated along the tube.
9.srt	00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:09.079	Let us try to do that.
9.srt	00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:10.829	So, how do you do it?
9.srt	00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:14.490	Let consider a single cube in here.
9.srt	00:10:17.789 --> 00:10:29.579	So, pressure is so, I can say this is a piston kind of things which produce the pressure in the air and that pressure is propagated along this tube.
9.srt	00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:40.429	So, if I consider a single cubicle let us I draw the picture neatly let us I consider a single cubicle.
9.srt	00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:58.549	inside the tube whose dimension let us consider the dimension are this is less del x del y let us del z del x del y del z.
9.srt	00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:08.539	So, let us volume is V is equal to del x del y del z.
9.srt	00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.690	So, this is the volume and this is the cube.
9.srt	00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.629	a small cube inside the tube I am considering.
9.srt	00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:19.990	Now, if I see there is a pressure wall in here.
9.srt	00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:28.039	So, the pressure is applied in here which is p. Let us I am saying.
9.srt	00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:41.599	So, if it is if the if there is no pressure is applied by the piston then inside the tube it is the atmospheric pressure atmospheric pressure means atmospheric pressure is what?
9.srt	00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:45.069	let us the that is the average pressure or atmospheric pressure what that is p 0.
9.srt	00:11:46.509 --> 00:12:10.949	Once the piston apply a force pressure then let us that is p. So, change pressure is a function of the piston may apply a force in here, how the pressure will propagate it that depends on the position where I am taking the position that x equal to 0 to L. So, this depend on the position and time.
9.srt	00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:14.359	So, change of pressure.
9.srt	00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:20.569	the pressure change is a function of position and time.
9.srt	00:12:21.309 --> 00:12:40.569	Now, if you see if I change if I apply a pressure ok, then what will happen the particle will start moving inside the tube, but average velocity of the particle is 0 because medium is homogeneous when sound wave is propagated medium does not change.
9.srt	00:12:45.219 --> 00:12:48.679	So, that means the particle velocity is exist I say medium is homogeneous.
9.srt	00:12:50.079 --> 00:13:03.229	So, I have already said some assumption I have taken that amplitude of the pressure wave is within the limit where the sound is transmitted linearly that is why we call this linear wave equation.
9.srt	00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:11.699	Now, if it is linear wave equation then how do I derive that wave equation?
9.srt	00:13:12.049 --> 00:13:13.879	So, what do you understand by the wave equation?
9.srt	00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:26.709	That means, Now, how the pressure from x equal to 0 is propagated along the tube, let us at x equal to L I want to know what is the pressure.
9.srt	00:13:27.369 --> 00:13:36.009	So, I want to know the pressure movement equation, mathematical equation of the change of pressure with respect to position and time.
9.srt	00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:48.009	And also mathematical equation for particle velocity with respect to position and time and also the relation between the.
9.srt	00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:55.069	pressure wave pressure with respect to position time with the particle velocity with position and time.
9.srt	00:13:55.619 --> 00:13:58.959	So, that I want to know that is why I want to know the derive those equation.
9.srt	00:13:59.989 --> 00:14:08.489	So, for deriving those equation you already studied it may be in acoustics or in wave equation derivation in first year physics.
9.srt	00:14:09.409 --> 00:14:19.019	We consider three principles of physics one is called Newton second law of motion second is called gas law of therionics.
9.srt	00:14:19.599 --> 00:14:23.459	and another one is conversion conservation of mass.
9.srt	00:14:24.819 --> 00:14:32.409	Think about if I apply a pressure in this this plane ok.
9.srt	00:14:32.709 --> 00:14:45.619	So, change of pressure and the pressure is exist in this plane is let us p 2 this is p 1 then I can say the pressure difference.
9.srt	00:14:45.809 --> 00:14:52.089	So, pressure if p 1 is the pressure then I know the pressure into area let us a 1 is the area.
9.srt	00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:54.089	and this is also a 1.
9.srt	00:14:54.399 --> 00:15:06.399	So, pressure into a 1 give me the force let us this is f 1 which is acting on this plane and force which is exiting from this end is nothing but a p 2 a 1.
9.srt	00:15:07.169 --> 00:15:14.089	So, difference of force is the cause of the motion of this particular this block.
9.srt	00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:23.599	So, I can say Newton's second law of motion the force equal to mass into acceleration.
9.srt	00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:38.500	So, the force resultant force cause an acceleration of that cube which is nothing but a force equal to mass into acceleration mass of the cube into acceleration.
9.srt	00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:48.519	Now, second law said the gas law of the hydrodynamic accelerate pressure volume and temperature under the adiabatic condition.
9.srt	00:15:53.779 --> 00:15:58.239	So, what is the meaning if I apply a pressure on this this block suppose there is a block I apply one plane one pressure is applied.
9.srt	00:15:59.309 --> 00:16:02.609	So, if it I apply a pressure the volume will be changed.
9.srt	00:16:04.419 --> 00:16:08.399	If the volume is changed mass should be changed, but mass will not change.
9.srt	00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:16.149	This increase the density due to the conservation of mass, mass will remain same density will be changed.
9.srt	00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:22.279	Volume will be changed because that cube will be deformed due to the applied pressure ok.
9.srt	00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:37.289	So, although the if the pressure is increases the volume is decreases, but mass of the cube will be remain same and this is an adiabatic condition.
9.srt	00:16:37.349 --> 00:16:54.099	So, I say there is a when the sound wave is propagated there is a no conduction of heat ok. Now, if that is the theory so using this three law we have to derive the wave equation.
9.srt	00:16:54.099 --> 00:16:57.059	So, again I can if you see the slides the assumption I have said.
9.srt	00:16:57.299 --> 00:17:04.939	medium is homogeneous, pressure change across the small distance, there is no friction in air particle, air particle velocity is small, sound is adiabatic.
9.srt	00:17:06.219 --> 00:17:10.309	Now, if I want to derive that equation, what I will do?
9.srt	00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:12.089	Let this is p 1.
9.srt	00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:18.299	So, I can say p 1 is nothing but a p 1 acting on the pressure.
9.srt	00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:26.939	So, it is p of x t, not capital P, small p. Okay.
9.srt	00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.129	change of pressure to for the d x distance.
9.srt	00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:43.490	So, it is nothing but a del p by del x into del x. I said change of pressure is linear, I am not considering the non-linear term ok.
9.srt	00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:48.939	This is the p 1 p 2 x.
9.srt	00:17:48.939 --> 00:17:57.869	So, if I say p 2 minus p 1 which is nothing but a p of x or I can say p 1 minus p 2.
9.srt	00:17:58.629 --> 00:18:01.219	acting of pressure in p 1 here it is p 2.
9.srt	00:18:01.399 --> 00:18:30.129	So, p 1 minus p 2 is nothing but a p of x t minus p of x plus del x t which is nothing but a p of x t minus p of x t minus del p y del x into del x.
9.srt	00:18:30.439 --> 00:18:36.309	Now, if I say what is the force acting on this plane multiply by the area.
9.srt	00:18:36.609 --> 00:18:38.649	So, it is A 1 multiply by A 1.
9.srt	00:18:39.069 --> 00:18:41.279	So, I can say the A 1 is multiply.
9.srt	00:18:42.739 --> 00:18:44.389	So, it is A 1 is multiply.
9.srt	00:18:45.699 --> 00:18:50.489	So, it is nothing but A 1 del p by del x into del x.
9.srt	00:18:50.979 --> 00:18:51.839	So, what is A 1?
9.srt	00:18:52.469 --> 00:18:54.379	It is a cross sectional area of this area.
9.srt	00:18:54.379 --> 00:18:56.989	So, this is nothing but a del z into del y.
9.srt	00:18:57.309 --> 00:19:00.659	So, I can say it is nothing but a minus.
9.srt	00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:16.849	del P by del x into del x del y del z because A is A 1 is equal to del y into del z.
9.srt	00:19:17.659 --> 00:19:19.259	So, I get the force.
9.srt	00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:22.269	So, it is nothing but a force acting on the cube.
9.srt	00:19:23.439 --> 00:19:28.069	So, force is equivalent to mass into acceleration Newton's second law of motion.
9.srt	00:19:28.509 --> 00:19:31.519	So, force is equal to mass into acceleration.
9.srt	00:19:32.729 --> 00:19:33.519	So, what is force?
9.srt	00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:42.799	Minus del P by del x into del x del y del z is equal to mass into acceleration.
9.srt	00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:43.589	What is acceleration?
9.srt	00:19:44.169 --> 00:19:52.299	Del V by d V by d t. Rate of change of particle velocity is the acceleration.
9.srt	00:19:52.729 --> 00:20:01.329	So, I can say it is nothing but a m into d V d t. This V is the particle velocity.
9.srt	00:20:03.709 --> 00:20:34.819	Now, if I say that then what is d v d t is a total derivative that and v is a function of x and t, v is a function of x and t. So, I can say d v d t is nothing, but a del v by del t plus v into del v by del x ok or not del v by del x.
9.srt	00:20:35.349 --> 00:21:04.739	Now, if I consider this term, this is a non-linear term, if I drop this term that this term is if the v the particle velocity is very small, particle velocity is less negligible in that case I can say that del d v by d t is nothing but a del v by del t.
9.srt	00:21:07.779 --> 00:21:27.549	So, in that case I can write minus del P by del x minus del P by del x is equal to M into del V by del t ok. What is M?
9.srt	00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:35.589	M is nothing but a density into volume which is sorry this that will be del x del y.
9.srt	00:21:36.639 --> 00:21:40.939	del z rho into volume.
9.srt	00:21:41.219 --> 00:21:50.099	So, rho volume means del x del y del z into del v by d t this will cancel.
9.srt	00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:16.619	So, I can write minus del p by del x is equal to rho del v by del t this is the equation number wave equation number 1 minus del p by del x is equal to rho del v by del rho into del V by del t. This is the equation number 1.
9.srt	00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:19.199	So, Newton's second law of motion.
9.srt	00:22:19.429 --> 00:22:21.489	Now, I come to the gas law.
9.srt	00:22:22.819 --> 00:22:23.679	What is gas law said?
9.srt	00:22:25.589 --> 00:22:38.039	P V is equal to n R T. You know n is moles of air, R is gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin.
9.srt	00:22:38.309 --> 00:22:40.059	That is the gas law, adiabatic gas law.
9.srt	00:22:40.279 --> 00:23:04.249	I can say or I can say p is equal to rho v divided by m into R T rho is the density v is the volume sorry p v v is the volume m is the molecular weight of the air and again R and T is there.
9.srt	00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:05.669	So, if you see here it is there.
9.srt	00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:37.209	So, p v is equal to n R T and p v is equal to rho v by m into Now, if I say then P is equal to I can say rho V V cancel rho RT divided by m rho RT into m. Now, you know the C square or C is equal to bulk modulus divided by that is you know.
9.srt	00:23:37.209 --> 00:23:41.669	So, bulk modulus divided by density.
9.srt	00:23:41.999 --> 00:24:04.989	So, instead of that I can write c is equal to root over of gamma r t by m where I derived that I am not deriving that one c is equal to so that that you can derive from the place of the adiabatic condition that if you required you can see the book and that is available and I can next day I can also that do that also if you required.
9.srt	00:24:05.419 --> 00:24:13.129	You send me the mail if it is required then I can derive that things also or you can see that my another lecture in audio system engineering.
9.srt	00:24:13.389 --> 00:24:15.529	derivation of linear wave equation.
9.srt	00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:23.699	Now, if C is equal to then I can say C square is equal to rho R T by gamma R T by m. What is gamma?
9.srt	00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:27.229	Gamma is not even specific heat ratio.
9.srt	00:24:29.429 --> 00:24:40.549	So, I can say from here I can say that P into gamma is equal to rho into C square.
9.srt	00:24:45.589 --> 00:24:48.019	P into is equal to rho into c square.
9.srt	00:24:49.189 --> 00:24:56.079	Another way I can say p v to the power gamma is equal to sorry.
9.srt	00:24:57.079 --> 00:25:02.989	So, another way I can say p v to the power gamma is equal to constant.
9.srt	00:25:08.249 --> 00:25:15.509	If I take the derivative with respect to t d d t of p v to the power gamma.
9.srt	00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:21.119	is nothing but a 0.
9.srt	00:25:22.009 --> 00:25:22.749	So, what is this?
9.srt	00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:39.969	I can write V to the power gamma into del P by del t plus P gamma V to the power gamma minus 1 del V by del t. This V is volume.
9.srt	00:25:49.489 --> 00:25:54.639	This V is capital V which is volume minus del V into del t is equal to 0 I can do that that is equal to 0.
9.srt	00:25:55.139 --> 00:26:05.499	Now, if I say what is V volume is nothing, but a A into del x cross sectional area into del x.
9.srt	00:26:05.499 --> 00:26:13.909	So, cube if you see the cube volume of the cube is nothing, but a y z plane cross sectional area del y into del z into del x.
9.srt	00:26:15.509 --> 00:26:20.349	Now, if I say d V or if I say del V.
9.srt	00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:43.189	by del t is nothing but a into del x by del t which is del v. If it is that then I can write a into del v by del x into del x I can write.
9.srt	00:26:46.949 --> 00:26:50.309	Now I put this one in here so what I get.
9.srt	00:26:50.679 --> 00:27:03.609	V to the power gamma del P by del t plus P gamma V to the power V to the power gamma minus 1 into A into del x.
9.srt	00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:05.549	What is A into del x?
9.srt	00:27:06.369 --> 00:27:08.129	Into del V by del x.
9.srt	00:27:08.309 --> 00:27:12.099	So, it is nothing but a V into del V by del x.
9.srt	00:27:12.299 --> 00:27:18.539	So, I can write V into del V by del x.
9.srt	00:27:19.649 --> 00:27:20.699	So, it is nothing but a.
9.srt	00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:22.969	v to the equal to 0.
9.srt	00:27:23.299 --> 00:27:43.679	So, v to the power gamma into del p by del t plus rho gamma into p into v minus 1 into v v, v to the power gamma del v by del x is equal to 0.
9.srt	00:27:52.159 --> 00:28:03.579	So, this v, is volume velocity and this capital V is the volume because here I have said del x by del t is nothing but a particle velocity sorry particle velocity sorry it is particle velocity.
9.srt	00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:05.819	So, this V is the particle velocity.
9.srt	00:28:06.999 --> 00:28:10.069	So, I can say V to the power gamma is cancel.
9.srt	00:28:10.179 --> 00:28:20.079	So, I can say del p by del t is nothing but a rho into p del V by del x is equal to 0.
9.srt	00:28:24.309 --> 00:28:42.749	So, I can say del p by del t is equal to minus rho p gamma p sorry gamma p into del v by del x which is nothing but a I said pressure into gamma is equal to rho c square.
9.srt	00:28:43.079 --> 00:28:48.759	So, I can say it is nothing but a minus rho c square del v by del x.
9.srt	00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:53.179	So, I can write another wave equation.
9.srt	00:28:53.179 --> 00:28:54.679	So, first wave equation was.
9.srt	00:28:55.739 --> 00:29:24.859	del P by del P by del x is equal to minus rho into del V by del t and here I get del P by del t is equal to minus rho c square del V by del x or another way I can write this one same way that I can write.
9.srt	00:29:25.169 --> 00:29:41.479	minus or minus del p by del x is equal to rho del v by del t and del p minus del p by del t is equal to rho c square del v by del x.
9.srt	00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:55.669	Now, if I want to know the pressure equation, so what I will do let us this equation derive with respect to del dx.
9.srt	00:29:55.989 --> 00:30:08.219	So, del square p by del x square let us minus is equal to rho into del v by del t into 1 by del x.
9.srt	00:30:09.689 --> 00:30:25.709	If I again do it in the respect to t minus del square p by del t square is equal to rho c square del v by del x into 1 by del t. So, if you see this side.
9.srt	00:30:26.179 --> 00:30:32.969	and this side what are the difference 1 by c square only 1 by c square if I multiply.
9.srt	00:30:32.969 --> 00:30:38.889	So, I can write minus del square p or minus this side minus this side minus.
9.srt	00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:55.559	So, I can write del square p by del x square is nothing but a 1 by c square into del p square by del p square or not.
9.srt	00:30:57.469 --> 00:31:10.079	Similarly, I can derive the same equation which is nothing but a del square v volume particle velocity by del x square is nothing but a 1 by c square del square v by del t square.
9.srt	00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:20.119	So, I can say this is the wave equation with this pressure wave equation this is the particle velocity wave equation.
9.srt	00:31:20.119 --> 00:31:27.439	So, I can say this is the wave equation with along when the wave is propagated along the x axis, but I am not considered the wave.
9.srt	00:31:27.729 --> 00:31:33.029	with the any particle velocity with the x y and y and z direction.
9.srt	00:31:33.309 --> 00:31:39.329	So, let us I say the wave is propagated along the x axis and there is a not other directional particle velocity.
9.srt	00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:42.769	So, friction force is not there, viscosity loss is not there.
9.srt	00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:43.389	So, nothing is there.
9.srt	00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:48.709	Then this is my velocity pressure equation, this is my velocity equation.
9.srt	00:31:49.329 --> 00:31:58.969	Now, I what I know, I know in the tube how the pressure wave is propagated.
9.srt	00:32:00.059 --> 00:32:02.599	how the pressure wave is propagated I know in the tube.
9.srt	00:32:03.469 --> 00:32:04.699	Now, I have to derive.
9.srt	00:32:05.219 --> 00:32:13.369	So, pressure wave mathematical equation I know, but I do not know what is the solution of the p. So, I have to second order differential equation.
9.srt	00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:22.149	I can solve that second order differential equation and find out the equation for p solution of the second order differential equation.
9.srt	00:32:22.829 --> 00:32:30.099	And then try to find out how what should be the transfer function of this vocal tract tube ok.
9.srt	00:32:30.369 --> 00:32:32.359	So, next class we try to derive.
9.srt	00:32:32.619 --> 00:32:34.939	the transfer function of single tube.
9.srt	00:32:35.289 --> 00:32:35.969	Thank you.
17.srt	00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:20.969	Now, last class we were discussing about the basilar membrane.
17.srt	00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:25.640	So, if you see this picture, this is the basilar membrane which is inside the cochlea.
17.srt	00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.379	So, the cochlea is full of liquid.
17.srt	00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.789	and basilar membrane is floated there.
17.srt	00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.210	So, you can see the basilar membrane divided the cochlea in two parts, one is called upper and lower part.
17.srt	00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.299	Now, this is the beginning part and this is the end part of the basilar membrane.
17.srt	00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.600	So, this is the apex and this is the base.
17.srt	00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:59.870	Along the cochlear membrane, there is a some you can say there is a some kind of normal arrangement that is called if you see it.
17.srt	00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:05.909	there is a we call inner hair cell.
17.srt	00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:11.269	So, there is a inner hair cell basilar membrane, there is a this kind of you can say the narval sensor.
17.srt	00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:15.539	Let us think about the narval sensor, there is a sensor kind of things in there.
17.srt	00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:31.420	So, if I see if I all along the basilar membrane and it is responsible the high frequency, high frequency sensing nerve are present in here and low frequency are here.
17.srt	00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.489	Why?
17.srt	00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:48.349	Because if you see in speech production side due to the radiation load the low frequency signals are high amplitude frequency or high amplitude compared to the high frequency.
17.srt	00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.950	So, the acoustics wave which is speech wave which is coming that has a high frequency or less amplitude compared to the low frequency sound.
17.srt	00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.689	So, the mechanical motion or high frequency mechanical motions are amplitude or less.
17.srt	00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:15.229	So, that is why this high frequency sensor are in the beginning and in the apex are the low frequency sensor.
17.srt	00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:25.039	Now, each this kind of sensor acts as an responsible for a particular frequency range.
17.srt	00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.009	So, I can say let this is the basilar membrane, let this divided with a this is the sensors.
17.srt	00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.599	each of the sensor is responsible for particular frequency band.
17.srt	00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:51.879	So, let us this perceive 0 to 5 hertz, let us this perceive 5 hertz to this 10 kilohertz or you can say 2 hertz to 10 6 hertz.
17.srt	00:02:52.509 --> 00:03:00.669	So, there is a overlapping frequency band is by perceived by each and every sensor.
17.srt	00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.939	So, I can see The Besselier membrane is nothing but a output of a different filter bank.
17.srt	00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:37.030	If I think in engineering model, I can think the human conversion of acoustical signal or you can mechanical signal to the normal signal is nothing but a sensor or nothing but a tank circuits or which is a particular filter or tank circuits or you can the sensor is active for a particular band.
17.srt	00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.349	then it is called tank circuit.
17.srt	00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.659	So, it is a tank circuit this is H 1 sensor, there will be H 2 sensor, there will be H 3 sensor.
17.srt	00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:52.449	So, H 1, H 2, H 3 is nothing, but a band pass filter I can consider.
17.srt	00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.879	So, I can say it is nothing, but a filter bank analysis by the human basilar membrane.
17.srt	00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:07.919	So, whatever the input signal come it pass through a particular band of filter and ultimately response of the each band.
17.srt	00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.590	is the neuron signal and that goes to the central brain system so that it can process for human cognition.
17.srt	00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:40.240	So, how it is convert mechanism is called inner hair cell there is a lot like the inner hair cell each of that sensor there is a 10 to I think 10 nerve fiber each of the different diameter one inner hair cell consist of 10 nerve fiber auditory nerve fiber.
17.srt	00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.310	So, that convert that things.
17.srt	00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:53.589	So, now come to that we know that how human being perceive the sound, how human basilar membrane convert that mechanical motion to normal motion.
17.srt	00:04:53.629 --> 00:05:05.019	Now, think about in engineering model we said so basilar membrane response maximally to different input frequency, frequency tuning occur at basilar moment.
17.srt	00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:15.349	So, I can say that each of the tank circuit is responsible for a particular frequency band which is a constant Q filter.
17.srt	00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:23.120	So, I can say let this is particular frequency band, this is also responsible is particular frequency band.
17.srt	00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.660	Then I want to know is this band are linear or is this band are non-linear.
17.srt	00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.660	So, bandwidth of the each of the particular filter is it linear overlapping or non-linear overlapping?
17.srt	00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.000	How do you define that?
17.srt	00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.329	How do you I do know that things whether it is a non-linear and linear?
17.srt	00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.970	So, we can do some experiment later I will come.
17.srt	00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.080	So, these bands are called you can say that Burke scale.
17.srt	00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.910	So, I will come later on that what is Burke scale.
17.srt	00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:23.330	So, physiologically I can say human perception or human the frequency which is heard by the human being or sound which is sense by a human being is done on the basilar membrane while it is as a different frequency tank circuit and bandwidth of non-linear then we will come later on that what is how do you define this non-linear scale.
17.srt	00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.040	Then how do you perceive the frequency?
17.srt	00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:36.260	We said each one is the particular band, if it is band then how do you perceive the frequency?
17.srt	00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:45.780	Because this is this is nothing but if it is this is this is a particular this is a nerve fiber this is nerve fiber if I say this is the high frequency and this is for low frequency.
17.srt	00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:55.700	Then are this suppose I said I have a frequency response 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz let us there is a.
17.srt	00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.080	100 tank circuit.
17.srt	00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.150	I know the bandwidth of each and each and tank circuit.
17.srt	00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:20.460	Now, suppose I want to perceive some, so is it is 20 hertz, it is 30 hertz like that way or non-linear way and whether this fiber, how this fiber is responsible particular frequency that I want to know.
17.srt	00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:27.000	So, this there is a two theory, one is called temporal frequency, which is called temporal theory and another is called place theory.
17.srt	00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:38.810	So, this first theory is that the basic of the temporal theory of the pitch perception is timing of neural firing which occur in response to vibration of the basilar membrane.
17.srt	00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.330	Timing of the neural firing is perceived as a frequency.
17.srt	00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.930	So, periodic stimulation of membrane match frequency of sound.
17.srt	00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.510	Once electrical impulse at every week, every peak.
17.srt	00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.190	Next one is called place theory.
17.srt	00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.610	Wave move.
17.srt	00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:16.050	down basilar membrane stimulation increase increases peak and peak quickly taper location of the peak if you see if the stimulation if the stimulation I have stimulated the cochlear and that increase the peak motion is.
17.srt	00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:21.100	So, I can say let us this is my basilar membrane this is my.
17.srt	00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:30.390	So, if I wave is mechanical wave is stimulated then this will be look like this wave is moving like this along the basilar membrane.
17.srt	00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.390	in a wave.
17.srt	00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:39.330	So, stimulus increases the peak and quickly taper if I say this portion is increase and taper increase and taper.
17.srt	00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.110	So, increase and taper and increase this kind of motion will be happen.
17.srt	00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:50.060	So, location of the peak depends on frequency of sound lower frequency being further away.
17.srt	00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:59.519	So, if the peak is occur in here location of the peak if occur in here then it it perceive the frequency.
17.srt	00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:05.269	So, there is a One is called timing, another is called location of the pin.
17.srt	00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:13.509	So, that is why local place theory, another is called frequency or temporal theory, frequency theory.
17.srt	00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.549	Now, human being perceive the sound.
17.srt	00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:28.759	So, I can say that human perception of an input sound has two part.
17.srt	00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:32.929	One is the perception of the frequency, another is the perception of the signal.
17.srt	00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.200	amplitude.
17.srt	00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:44.500	So, if I produce a you can say the let us 500 hertz acoustic signal, it has a frequency, it has an amplitude.
17.srt	00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:53.240	So, human being perceive frequency and also perceive as well as perceive the amplitude of the particular frequency.
17.srt	00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.360	So, two perception things is there.
17.srt	00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:04.149	Now I have to know how accurate we are in perception of amplitude and frequency.
17.srt	00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.810	What do you mean by accuracy?
17.srt	00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.129	You can say think about the resolution.
17.srt	00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:27.620	So, suppose I have a straight line and I want to measure the straight line in some small scale or I say there is a line which is like this.
17.srt	00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:34.850	If I want to measure in a scale small scale, why put the scale along this line?
17.srt	00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:43.120	Now, if my scale is larger, then I put the scale here and again I put the scale here.
17.srt	00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:52.540	Now, if you see if I approximate it long section, then I may lose some error or I may introduce some error.
17.srt	00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:02.150	So, that means, how accurately I can perceive the sound.
17.srt	00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.610	So, either a human being perceive every harsh of the sound.
17.srt	00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:18.310	If it is possible that the human being will perceive 1 hertz, 2 hertz, 3 hertz, 4 hertz, 5 hertz, 6 hertz, 7 hertz and like that way or for a particular frequency in a band.
17.srt	00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:34.840	Similarly, if I increase the intensity, are we able to linearly perceive the intensity increase or in which scale, whether I able to differentiate between the 2 dB and 2.5 dB or 2.12 dB or not.
17.srt	00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.460	So, that is the resolving power of the human being.
17.srt	00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.050	I have to know.
17.srt	00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.320	How good an estimation of the fundamental frequency?
17.srt	00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:54.250	So, in the frequency domain and intensity domain, there is a some parameter.
17.srt	00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:01.310	Fundamental frequency, the resolving power is 0.3 to 0.5 percent.
17.srt	00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:19.680	So, if I say my F 0 is 200 hertz and somebody's F 0 is is less 201 hertz, whether can I am able to differentiate between this 200 hertz and 201 hertz?
17.srt	00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.750	It said it is 0.3 to 0.5 percent.
17.srt	00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:34.540	That means, if the difference is lie between this range, we cannot differentiate the two frequency, two frequency.
17.srt	00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.200	So, we cannot separate them.
17.srt	00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.920	So, let us 0.3.
17.srt	00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.600	So, 0.3 percent means 0.3 divided by 100 into 200 let us say 0.6.
17.srt	00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:55.070	So, if it is let us if it is for the 300 hertz, 300 hertz then 0.9.
17.srt	00:12:55.070 --> 00:13:05.000	So, I can say approximately 201 hertz frequency and 200 hertz frequency I cannot differentiate.
17.srt	00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.290	If it is 1 kilohertz then 0.3 by 100 into 1 k it is nothing but a 3 hertz.
17.srt	00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:23.560	So, if I say the perception of the frequency is different in different frequency range.
17.srt	00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.580	So, this is not a linear scale it is a non-linear perception.
17.srt	00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:37.320	So, how do you perceive if it is high frequency the difference the perception will be more rough I can say the bandwidth will be perception bandwidth is a larger.
17.srt	00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:50.350	So, I can say that initially for the low frequency my resolving power is very high, but at high frequency resolving power is very low.
17.srt	00:13:51.430 --> 00:14:11.520	So, that means, at high frequency I cannot separate the 2 less 3 1 kilo hertz and 1.100 1.03 003 3 hertz that I cannot kilo hertz I cannot separate, but at low frequency almost 1 hertz difference I can understand.
17.srt	00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:23.940	So, low frequency level human perception reservation power is much more high frequency level we do not have that much of reservation power ok.
17.srt	00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:31.510	So, in high frequency accuracy so, suppose a suppose I want to copy an instrument.
17.srt	00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:45.320	So, I can say high frequency details information are not that much of required because human being cannot perceive the high frequency in a high resolution.
17.srt	00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.800	fundamental then the formant frequency you know the formant frequency is nothing but a formant position in the speech so fast formant around 500 hertz ok if it is uniform to 500 hertz so almost 500 around 500 hertz will be the fast formant so i can say 3 to 5 percent so if it is 500 hertz then 3 divided by 100 into 500 so almost 15 hertz error in formant being cannot differentiate.
17.srt	00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:26.290	So, suppose I extract a formant frequency of a particular vowel, let us see 450 hertz.
17.srt	00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:43.470	If it is differ by 10 hertz instead of 450, if it is 460 hertz, then also human being cannot distinguish the difference, because we do not have resolving power of this formant position.
17.srt	00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.310	Then, formant bandwidth, this is the formant bandwidth, 20 to 40 percent error.
17.srt	00:15:52.080 --> 00:16:07.760	So, suppose R let us R has a form and first form and bandwidth let us 65 hertz even if instead of 65 we if it is 20 percent error.
17.srt	00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.190	So, 20 to 40 percent variation we cannot distinguish.
17.srt	00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.000	So, let us 30 percent variation we cannot distinguish.
17.srt	00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.630	So, 30 divided by 100 into 65.
17.srt	00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:25.480	18 hertz difference.
17.srt	00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:32.150	So, instead of 65, even if it is 65 plus 18 hertz, then also we cannot see any difference.
17.srt	00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:49.630	That is called just noticeable difference J N D. So, due to the limitation of human perception, we cannot distinguish.
17.srt	00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.080	if the range is within this limit.
17.srt	00:16:53.990 --> 00:17:04.620	Intensity 1.5 dB overall, if it is 50 dB and if it is less 51.5 dB, no difference.
17.srt	00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:12.200	For a same frequency, if the two 50 dB and 51.5 dB, we cannot perceive the differences.
17.srt	00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:19.519	Now, I come to the physical dimension of the sound.
17.srt	00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:25.680	and physiological or you can say the cycle or the perceptual dimension of the sound.
17.srt	00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:33.710	So, that is obvious you know that that height of the amplitude, frequency, wavelength and their property you know that.
17.srt	00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.730	Now, I call auditory perception.
17.srt	00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.830	So, auditory perception is branch of psychophysics you know that.
17.srt	00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.380	So, perception and physiological physical property of stimuli.
17.srt	00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.040	So, physical dimension as we have said is the measurable, but perceptual dimension is the mental exercise or you can say physiological output.
17.srt	00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:05.890	If I excited by a physical stimulus, what kind of output I observe based on that characteristics, I can measure the perceptual dimension parameter.
17.srt	00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:14.040	Now, if it is sound I have not detailed discuss about the human visual auditory system, visual psychophysics, auditory psychophysics.
17.srt	00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:20.880	Pitch, loudness, timbre are called perceptual dimension of the speech.
17.srt	00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:25.740	or you can say the sound wave or sound sound perception of the human being.
17.srt	00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:39.009	Pitch, loudness, timbre, physical properties, fundamental frequency, intensity, spectrum envelope or amplitude envelope you can say.
17.srt	00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:40.869	So, what is this?
17.srt	00:18:41.779 --> 00:18:46.819	If you say pitch, sometime you see that many of you may be practices music.
17.srt	00:18:46.869 --> 00:18:54.819	You say that somebody guru said that you set the harmonium at flat B scale.
17.srt	00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:02.019	because your pitch will be around let us 200 hertz so flat B or 180 hertz flat B.
17.srt	00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.950	So, that is nothing but a average pitch.
17.srt	00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.660	We say average pitch, but pitch is a perceptual parameter.
17.srt	00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:19.340	So, 180 hertz is nothing but a fundamental frequency average fundamental frequency of that signal not the pitch.
17.srt	00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:27.310	So, we sometime we say the pitch example is that suppose you say I play a tanpura.
17.srt	00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:46.640	and a harmonium and a say the guitar let us saw and with the same frequency harmonium saw has 200 hertz, Tanpura saw also has a 200 hertz also let us the Tanpura harmonium and guitar 200 hertz.
17.srt	00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:57.410	All instrument are producing saw of the same frequency, same frequency saw, but even a by closing my eyes.
17.srt	00:19:57.839 --> 00:20:04.599	I can identify this sound is coming from harmonium, this is for tanpura, this is for let us guitar.
17.srt	00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:06.369	So, how do you find out?
17.srt	00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.700	All if the all pitch are same, if I say the fundamental frequency is the pitch.
17.srt	00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:26.190	So, pitch is an perceptual parameter, it may include something else for which we can understand this is the source of the sound is different, although they are produced in the same fundamental frequency.
17.srt	00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.380	So, that is the pitch in perceptual domain.
17.srt	00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:37.560	So, main parameter physical domain parameter of pitch is called fundamental frequency or F 0.
17.srt	00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:43.830	Many places I referred to F 0 also F 0 fundamental frequency of that sound.
17.srt	00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:56.840	Then loudness intensity physical parameter is intensity I can measure the intensity 5 dB, 6 dB, 7 dB, but loudness is in perceptual parameter.
17.srt	00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.420	I can say this is louder sound.
17.srt	00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.019	compared to previous sound.
17.srt	00:21:02.369 --> 00:21:06.509	This is louder sound compared to previous sound.
17.srt	00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.259	So, loudness is a perceptual parameter, intensity is a physical parameter.
17.srt	00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:26.380	Timber or sound quality, if you see I can give an example, same musical grammar, same lyrics is generated from a two female speaker.
17.srt	00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.650	Let us, Lothar Munger score use the same lyrics.
17.srt	00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.519	same musical note position and his same.
17.srt	00:21:35.519 --> 00:22:00.940	So, his song the Lothar Munchenko sing a song record a song same lyrics same musical grammar is followed by some other singer also let us he does not make any mistake and also produce the same song, but we can able to distinguish this song I say if you perceive it we say this song is better than this.
17.srt	00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:01.450	Why?
17.srt	00:22:04.119 --> 00:22:12.190	Because if I control this thing, then I can say the movement of the speech of the singing grammar is same.
17.srt	00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.789	He also followed the same note, same position, same duration also.
17.srt	00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.700	Then why this speaker this is better than this?
17.srt	00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:30.880	Because of the timbre, complexity of the speech.
17.srt	00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.819	If this complexity I may like much more, compared to this speech complexity.
17.srt	00:22:38.769 --> 00:22:51.710	So, the production mechanism that complexity or you can say physical dimension is called spectral structures, we say it is spectral structures.
17.srt	00:22:52.259 --> 00:23:04.009	So, our timber or complexity of the speech is in perceptual dimension, I can say this complexity, but if I say how do you measure it?
17.srt	00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:12.710	One of the procedure is spectral envelope, spectral composition of this segment and this segment will be different.
17.srt	00:23:14.319 --> 00:23:27.809	So, pitch, loudness, timbre, perceptual dimension, fundamental frequency, intensity and spectrum envelope is the properties of physical dimension of the sound.
17.srt	00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:35.559	Similarly, you can see that there is a hue, brightness and sharpness, not shape, and then wavelength, luminance.
17.srt	00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.570	contrast all kind of things are there in perceptual dimension also.
17.srt	00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:48.740	How human being is perceive a picture that is called visual perception of a human being.
17.srt	00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.140	So, we have a again limitation in human perception of visual dimension also.
17.srt	00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.770	So, speech dimension I have a limitation.
17.srt	00:23:55.030 --> 00:24:01.650	So, I have to find out that limitation and you can say the visual dimension there is a limitation.
17.srt	00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.890	So, there is experiment to find out those limitation.
17.srt	00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.180	Now, I am not describing this thing.
17.srt	00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:18.660	Now, human range of hearing sound frequency and sound direction both sound frequency and sound direction threshold of hearing.
17.srt	00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.210	So, there is a human threshold of hearing.
17.srt	00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:39.130	So, threshold of hearing that means the minimum pressure acoustical pressure which can create a sensation in our nervous system is called threshold of hearing.
17.srt	00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:55.950	So, suppose I produce a 1 kilohertz acoustical signal of pressure p, we just create the human sensation in the ears, then of normal hearing person, person must be normal hearing person not defect.
17.srt	00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.500	So, there is defect I have not discussed in here.
17.srt	00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:09.110	So, for a normal hearing person, the required amount of pressure to create just a sensation in the human ear.
17.srt	00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.190	is called threshold of hearing.
17.srt	00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:30.850	Now, if I if you remember I said the perception or you can say the intensity perception of a human being for different frequency is different because of the outer air and middle air frequency response if you if I draw that.
17.srt	00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:40.420	So, I can say the sensation created the amount of pressure required to create a sensation for 1 kilo hertz.
17.srt	00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.320	and create a sensation for 300 hertz signal may be will be different.
17.srt	00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:55.480	So, 300 hertz signal required more power to create the sensation, but 1 kilohertz signal required less power to create the sensation.
17.srt	00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:08.620	So, if I able to define the threshold of hearing, then for a particular you are defining the threshold of hearing hearing for measuring the intensity.
17.srt	00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.330	I can say let us define the frequency.
17.srt	00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:17.990	for which I can say threshold of hearing we said it is 0 dB.
17.srt	00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:35.200	So, 0 dB is called threshold of hearing decibel for that particular sound play sound intensity which require to create the sensation for 1 kilohertz signal.
17.srt	00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:48.950	So, I can say 1 kilohertz acoustical signal or 1 kilohertz monotone the amount of intensity required to create the sensation in human ear.
17.srt	00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.370	is called 0 dB.
17.srt	00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.250	So, one way say 0 dB it is not defined for all frequency.
17.srt	00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:13.770	0 dB means I take a 1 kilohertz acoustical signal or monotone signal and I want to find out the intensity I which just create a sensation in the human being that I call 0 dB.
17.srt	00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.900	So, that I is called 10 to the power minus 12 watt.
17.srt	00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.870	I think 10 to the power minus 12 watt.
17.srt	00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.990	12 watt per meter square.
17.srt	00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.250	So, this is threshold of hearing.
17.srt	00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.620	So, that is defined by 0 dB.
17.srt	00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.620	So, what is dB?
17.srt	00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.470	What is dB?
17.srt	00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.160	Sometimes we said it is dB.
17.srt	00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.260	dB is called decibel decibel.
17.srt	00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.450	So, dB.
17.srt	00:27:53.590 --> 00:28:14.340	is equal to log of I by I reference, where I reference is related to the 10 to the power minus 12 watt per meter square, which is defined as a 0 dB.
17.srt	00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:19.130	So, decibel, so deci means 1 by 10.
17.srt	00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:32.020	So, decibel means 1 bell is equal to 10 log i by i reference decibel dB, decibel.
17.srt	00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.650	So, if the intensity of a sound is i, then I can say convert in dB is nothing but a 10 log i by i reference, where i reference is equal to 10 to the power minus 12 watt per meter square.
17.srt	00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:11.430	So, sound intensity of a sound is a physical quantity that can be measured and quantify acoustic intensity I define as average flow of energy through an unit area.
17.srt	00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:21.200	Area per you can say the power per unit area or force per unit area is nothing but intensity power per unit area is nothing but intensity.
17.srt	00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.140	So, watt per square meter I by I 0 is equal to minus 12 watt.
17.srt	00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:43.120	Now, decibel similarly if it is instead of I, I is equal to p square by 2 rho c or if it is RMS all kind of conversion I can say.
17.srt	00:29:43.490 --> 00:30:01.680	Similarly, instead of I if it is measured in pressure then I can say 20 log p by p reference where p reference for if you see p reference for air is 20 micro Pascal.
17.srt	00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.180	for water is 1 micro Pascal.
17.srt	00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.870	So, pre reference intensity in air is minus.
17.srt	00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:28.330	So, this is also depends on our the conducts the intensity the I said the threshold of hearing is the amount of sound pressure required to create a sensation in human ear for a 1 kilohertz acoustic wave ok.
17.srt	00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.400	So, I can if it is water then the amount pressure the medium is water So, it required less amount of intensity.
17.srt	00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:51.850	So, this I am not going details this is acoustical part then conversion of dB to percentage kind of things there is a some mathematics also you can say then loudness curve.
17.srt	00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:10.670	Now, if you remember the combined frequency response of the outer air and middle air I can say this is look like this.
17.srt	00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:27.040	So, this way is the frequency, this way is the loudness in dB reference is 10 to the power minus 12 watt 0 dB.
17.srt	00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:36.540	Now, if you see the for this frequency and for this frequency let us this is for 1 kilohertz.
17.srt	00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:45.580	this is 5 kilo Hertz, let this is 200 Hertz let us.
17.srt	00:31:47.960 --> 00:32:07.810	Now, intense intensity required to create a sensation for a 200 Hertz signal will be require high amplitude, intensity created for 300 Hertz signal let us required high amplitude for 1 kilo Hertz this amplitude 5 kilo Hertz this amplitude.
17.srt	00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:14.400	So, this is called threshold of hearing curve for different frequency.
17.srt	00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.980	So, this is the minimum intensity required to create a sensation human ear.
17.srt	00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:39.440	Since the frequency response for different frequency the intensity frequency response of the intensity for different frequency the intensity of the sound perception is different that is why I said for 200 hertz I required a larger intensity sound.
17.srt	00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.800	to create the threshold of hearing compared to 1 kilohertz.
17.srt	00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:52.820	Similarly, I can say let this is a 10 dB curve.
17.srt	00:32:53.340 --> 00:33:12.440	So, let us 10 dB at 1 kilohertz to perceive the same loudness for 200 hertz signal, I require larger intensity to perceive the 300 hertz signal.
17.srt	00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:24.540	I require larger intensity, but along this line the loudness which I perceive will be the same.
17.srt	00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:43.260	So, you want to know 1 kilo Hertz 10 dB, may be 300 Hertz, may be 20 dB I required intensity, but if I perceive that sound loudness of the sound will be the same.
17.srt	00:33:43.690 --> 00:34:03.600	So, I can say if I go along this line the loudness will be same that is why it is called equal loudness curve or phone curve equal loudness curve or phone curve.
17.srt	00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:13.070	So, along the other line loudness will be equal let us say it is 20 dB curve.
17.srt	00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:16.110	So, perception of sound this is the perception of sound.
17.srt	00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:30.889	intensity is different intensity for 1 kilohertz it is 10 dB may be here intensity is 25 dB, but perception of the sound is same that is why it is called this line is called equal loudness curve.
17.srt	00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:42.469	So, loudness is a perceptual quantity that is related to the physical property level or pressure level of sound or intensity, but it is not direct intensity.
17.srt	00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:46.959	So, this curve is called foam curve.
17.srt	00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.940	or equal loudness curve.
17.srt	00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.360	Now, how do you then measure loudness in shown?
17.srt	00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.050	Sometime it is called also shown.
17.srt	00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:04.320	Now, I want to find out the relations between the intensity and loudness.
17.srt	00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:06.680	How do you do it?
17.srt	00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:24.170	So, I can say I design a perceptual experiment for I take a normal hearing capability sound and this axis I put normal human capability of normal hearing capability human being I take.
17.srt	00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.370	I produce loudness in phone.
17.srt	00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:40.680	So, I take let us 1 kilohertz acoustical signal 1 kilohertz acoustical signal I take or equal loudness curve if I then composition we have to take.
17.srt	00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.110	So, let us 1 kilohertz signal.
17.srt	00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:49.920	Then I produce take the let us intensity A A d B.
17.srt	00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.660	and I produce the sound listeners perceive it.
17.srt	00:35:55.150 --> 00:36:02.120	Then again I produce the take A 1, A 1 dB listener perceive it.
17.srt	00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:13.980	I told the listeners when you perceive the sound is twice than this A dB you raise your hand.
17.srt	00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.850	So, I first produce let us A dB sound to the listeners I told him.
17.srt	00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:30.690	and next a 1 d b and gradually I increasing the d b. I told the listener when you perceive the loudness is double then you raise your hand.
17.srt	00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:42.620	Then I will can say the here you perceive the loudness is double, here you perceive the loudness is double, here you perceive the loudness is double then I can draw that curve.
17.srt	00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.200	Then I derive the equation of the curve.
17.srt	00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:59.200	1 and find out the loudness scale and relation b to the intense this is intensity and this is the loudness.
17.srt	00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:06.750	So, loudness and intensity relation this is the derivation of the loudness and intensity relation I am not deriving it again.
17.srt	00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:13.210	So, L is equal to 445 i to the power 0.333.
17.srt	00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:19.330	So, that can say if I know the intensity equal loudness in shown.
17.srt	00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.300	So, this will be shown s o n e.
17.srt	00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.180	S that much of sounds.
17.srt	00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:31.600	So, L is equal to 445 I to the power 0.33.
17.srt	00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:37.340	So, if it is 5 dB I if I know the intensity then I can calculate loudness.
17.srt	00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:44.780	So, this is the loudness sound curve.
17.srt	00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:52.960	Then there is a example this is called sound pressure level for different if it is 160 state engine close up.
17.srt	00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.330	threshold of pain 130.
17.srt	00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:03.270	So, you see this we should not expose to the large amount of sound large or high amplitude of sound.
17.srt	00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.850	If it is high amplitude, it can create pain in our ear.
17.srt	00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.830	So, threshold of pain is 20 to 130 dB.
17.srt	00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:19.720	If I expose to a sound intensity of 130 dB, it can create a pain in the ears.
17.srt	00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:26.200	And also if I expose more than that, then my ear permanently can be damaged also.
17.srt	00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:37.530	So, then if you see the pollution control board has said that do not produce do not produce the sound which is more than 60 dB.
17.srt	00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:54.900	Is more than 60 dB it may cause hearing problem or it not it is not good to expose in a sound always above 60 dB sound environment then you may have some problem in your listening.
17.srt	00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.270	Today we will see.
17.srt	00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:11.150	lot of people are wearing a headphone many time many may lets that in 24 hour 8 hours or 12 hour they wearing the headphone what is the problem what can effect.
17.srt	00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:34.370	So, once is that once you wearing a headphone it lose sound localization is lost that means, you wearing a headphone and walking in a road you cannot you cannot distinguish where the car is coming on your front or in your back forget about that you just close your eyes you cannot listen that horn also and also car noise also car sound also.
17.srt	00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:40.090	So, if you wearing a headphone sound localization happen inside your ear.
17.srt	00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.630	Now, if you expose your ear with a continuous stimulus.
17.srt	00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.100	So, this is a 24 hour you are listening a music.
17.srt	00:39:50.720 --> 00:40:00.880	So, you are exposed your human ear is exposed to a continuous vibration that can damage the elasticity problem of your middle ear.
17.srt	00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.420	So, the elasticity of your middle ear.
17.srt	00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.740	may be lost.
17.srt	00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.950	Then what will happen that may be response curve will change.
17.srt	00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:17.400	So, you may be your distinguishing sound listening capability.
17.srt	00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:26.620	So, low intensity sound you may not able to listen or you can you cannot heard the low intensity sound.
17.srt	00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:34.820	So, your threshold of hearing will be increased continuous exposure to the sound.
17.srt	00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:35.930	So, that is why if you see.
17.srt	00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:42.250	The person who are working in a factory environment, his threshold of hearing is increased.
17.srt	00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:47.500	So, he cannot he cannot intense low intensity sound he cannot heard.
17.srt	00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:52.570	So, your sensitivity of the your ear is decreasing that is the problem.
17.srt	00:40:53.380 --> 00:41:06.590	So, do not expose your or do not you expose expose your ear continuously in a sound environment, do not expose your ear to a very high intensity loudness high loud sound.
17.srt	00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:11.890	because that can permanently damage your ear ok.
17.srt	00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.710	So, do not expose that things.
17.srt	00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:23.710	So, there is a sound propagation you know that even if a source is produced 120 dB you may say I am if it is I 10 feet away then you know the 1 by r square.
17.srt	00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.870	So, I is reduced in 1 by r square form.
17.srt	00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:31.170	So, if you distance is double 6 dB every doubling the distance 6 dB down.
17.srt	00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:37.350	So, if it is source away from the source 10 feet it will reduce the sound intensity.
17.srt	00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:45.660	but do not always expose in a large sound so that your ear sensitivity is lost ok.
17.srt	00:41:45.889 --> 00:41:48.440	So, there is threshold of hearing, threshold of pain all are there.
17.srt	00:41:48.760 --> 00:42:07.430	If you see this curve sound intensity level and the this is the black line is threshold of hearing, this is the music and this is the speech region loudness of the speech region ok. Contour of damage risk and threshold of pain is here.
17.srt	00:42:10.869 --> 00:42:15.079	So, next class we will discuss about the frequency perception.
17.srt	00:42:16.219 --> 00:42:16.469	Thank you.
16.srt	00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:23.710	So, let us discuss that we have discussed about the speech perception ok.
16.srt	00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.460	So, this class I will may be it is required two lectures.
16.srt	00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.250	So, during this two lectures we discuss about the how human being perceive the speech.
16.srt	00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:48.059	So, if you ask the why we have to know about the human speech perception because if I talk about the digital speech processing then why we require that we should know that digital speech perception the speech perception kind of things.
16.srt	00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:24.079	Now if you if you see that human being ultimately we want to copy the human being through a machine or you can say we want to developed an algorithm or technology by which a machine can act as a human being or we can use the speech communication among the human being and that communication we want to establish in machine ok. Now, if I want to do that in speech communication if you see speech production and speech perception.
16.srt	00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:31.900	So, two parts speech production human being produce the speech and listeners perceive the speech ok.
16.srt	00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.170	So, better we understand the how human being perceive the speech.
16.srt	00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.849	We can better model that we can better process the speech signal that way.
16.srt	00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:56.859	On the other hand, if I say if I produce a speech and a human listener perceive the speech, how human listener process the speech to perceive it is very important to know.
16.srt	00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.359	Because unless we do not know what we perceive, the development of technology will be not possible.
16.srt	00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:09.120	So, we want to know what kind of speech processing happen in our brain.
16.srt	00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:21.419	And, if try to follow that kind of processing in digital speech domain so that we can develop the speech technology like the speech coding.
16.srt	00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:30.339	If you see that a speech let us the example of speech recognition and speech coding or speech recognition let us the example of speech recognition.
16.srt	00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:40.159	So, what listeners is produced the what the speaker is produced that listen by the listeners and he perceive.
16.srt	00:02:41.129 --> 00:03:00.949	Same technology we want to produce in machine that in front of a microphone we want to speak out that was speech signal or the speaker output we want to give and from the microphone and the signal processing technique I want to develop how human being perceive the speech.
16.srt	00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:10.279	So if I want to develop that technology we should know that signal processing involve in human brain.
16.srt	00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.309	What kind of signal processing involve in the human brain?
16.srt	00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.099	So, that we want to know that is the speech perception.
16.srt	00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.729	How we perceive the speech?
16.srt	00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.059	Forget about this speech chain.
16.srt	00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:31.479	So, if you see the auditory systems, we perceive the speech through the auditory systems of the human being.
16.srt	00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:41.229	So, if I see that a human being, a human listeners first convert that acoustical signal.
16.srt	00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.579	to some nerve signal or nerve response we can say.
16.srt	00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.959	So, that require a transduction.
16.srt	00:03:49.599 --> 00:04:07.579	So, trans or transducer which will convert the input acoustical signal to a nerve signal and that nervous signal that signal which is in the nerve will goes to the brain and process it and perceive the speech.
16.srt	00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:13.409	So, we have there is a three two we can say the two part or you can say the three part.
16.srt	00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.699	by the ear.
16.srt	00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:16.639	So, we have ear.
16.srt	00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:23.769	So, function of the ear to convert that input acoustic signal to the neural signal that is the process.
16.srt	00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:41.229	Then neural transduction step take place between the output of the inner ear and neural pathway that means whatever the output is coming from the neural transduction has to be taken away to the processing unit and nerve firing signal.
16.srt	00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.749	So, auditor there is a human brain.
16.srt	00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.949	So, brain process that firing signal.
16.srt	00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:50.069	and perceive or understand the speech ok.
16.srt	00:04:50.259 --> 00:05:04.349	So, perceive and understanding is happen in brain ok. Now, we have to know what kind of transduction is happen and what kind of processing in happen in human brain.
16.srt	00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:12.829	So, that two things we have to know to know the human perception or rather I can say what kind of.
16.srt	00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:20.809	So, if you see the if you study the microphone, the purpose of the microphone is that it has to be convert that acoustical signal.
16.srt	00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:48.839	signal to a electrical signal ok. Now, I have to know that ok this microphone has the how efficiently this microphone can convert the acoustical signal to electrical signal or I can say the properties of acoustical signal how accurately impose on electrical signal that is the electrical.
16.srt	00:05:48.839 --> 00:06:03.009	So, acoustical signal is equivalent to electrical signal if the all properties of acoustical signal like that its frequency repaint or you can say frequency composition or its amplitude all things how it is represent in electrical signal.
16.srt	00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:04.329	is the important point.
16.srt	00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:19.319	So, that means, how efficiently a microphone convert the acoustical signal to electrical signal is the property or is the you can say the construction depends on the construction mechanism of the microphone.
16.srt	00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.299	Similarly, human being has an ear, two ear if you say two ears.
16.srt	00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:33.439	So, how efficiently human ear can convert the input acoustical signal to the output.
16.srt	00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:35.849	signal or nerve signal.
16.srt	00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:54.079	So, I want what kind of limitation this system is imposed on speech perception that means, human being or what kind of you can say that what kind of constraint it put on the human speech signal conversion.
16.srt	00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:58.619	So, that that kind of constraint we can exploit in speech processing.
16.srt	00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:02.539	So, that human being cannot heard that error.
16.srt	00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:08.289	So, suppose if you a microphone has if you see the microphone has a frequency response.
16.srt	00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:10.079	Let us discuss about the frequency response.
16.srt	00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:28.579	Suppose, a microphone has a frequency response, if you know the frequency response because frequency response is nothing but a frequency versus amplitude plot that means, for a particular intensity sound of different frequency how it represent in electrical signal.
16.srt	00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:35.539	So, suppose a microphone has a frequency response whose flat area is around let us from here.
16.srt	00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:40.929	it is 30 hertz to 10 kilohertz.
16.srt	00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:44.909	So, that is data set is given that this is the microphone.
16.srt	00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:54.459	So, this microphone is efficient to convert the acoustical signal in between 30 hertz to 10 kilohertz and produce the electrical signal.
16.srt	00:07:55.099 --> 00:08:07.659	So, if an acoustical signal consist of 12 kilohertz, the electrical signal should not contain that component because that micro the response of the microphone at 12 kilohertz is almost 0.
16.srt	00:08:08.489 --> 00:08:11.549	maybe almost 0 let us it is down in here is 12 kilohertz.
16.srt	00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:12.969	So, it is 0 almost 0.
16.srt	00:08:13.529 --> 00:08:16.749	So, I cannot get 12 kilohertz response in here.
16.srt	00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:23.709	So, that means, the limitation which is imposed by the microphone in electrical signal is 30 hertz to 10 kilohertz.
16.srt	00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:26.419	Similarly, suppose I have a human ear.
16.srt	00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:31.529	So, acoustical signal human ear convert into normal signal.
16.srt	00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:38.469	So, perception of that signal that how we perceive what is the limitation of our.
16.srt	00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:43.809	perception that is the limitation of conversion by the ear to nerve signal.
16.srt	00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:55.639	So, limitation of perception how weak signal we can perceive, how which frequency we cannot perceive all kind of limitation is imposing here.
16.srt	00:08:56.789 --> 00:09:04.959	So, if I say first impose is the 20 hertz to 20 kilo hertz frequency we can heard.
16.srt	00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:13.319	So, ear can convert only the acoustical signal which is lie between 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz.
16.srt	00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:26.659	If I apply 22 kilohertz to the human ear it will not perceive it might may not be converted to nervous system or nervous system cannot represent or cannot sensitize a response in the human brain.
16.srt	00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:37.879	So, I have to know how this signal or how this acoustical signal is converted to normal signal.
16.srt	00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.240	So, that is the physiological mechanism we have to understand the physiological mechanism.
16.srt	00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:45.240	of the human ear.
16.srt	00:09:46.049 --> 00:09:59.929	So, if you see I come this one let on human has two ears if you see a human has two ears why a human has two ears if I do not have one ear what will be the problem.
16.srt	00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:14.870	So, sound the two ears help to localize the sound sound localization if you close your eyes and if your sound is come from some direction you can tell that some sound is coming from this direction.
16.srt	00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:22.659	If the sound is coming from this direction without seeing the source, you can identify the direction of the source.
16.srt	00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:31.110	So, that means, localization of the sound is because of we have two ears.
16.srt	00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:39.009	If you see that there is a home the stereo earlier there is a mono then comes stereo then comes surround sound.
16.srt	00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.590	So, all are effect of sound localization because if it is stereo sound that means, we can identify the source of the direction or source direction from the sound.
16.srt	00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:09.120	Dolby surround sound, suppose you are watching a movie where a train is coming from left corner of the screen to right corner that means it is a three dimensional you are visualizing in a two dimensional respects.
16.srt	00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:17.870	Now if I say suppose I am standing in here a train is coming from this direction and it is going this direction.
16.srt	00:11:18.259 --> 00:11:19.689	So, what is the effect of sound?
16.srt	00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:38.669	If the train sound is coming from this direction, so I should able to localize the train sound is coming from my right hand this side and the sound intensity will be increases when train come to my place and when train is going away then I can say the sound is coming from this direction.
16.srt	00:11:39.289 --> 00:11:46.209	So, if I able to manipulate this effect then I can say it is a surround sound because sound is coming from this direction.
16.srt	00:11:46.209 --> 00:11:48.590	So, I can understand sound is coming from this direction.
16.srt	00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:59.389	So, sound localization is one of the major issues because human has a two ears that is why we can localize the sound.
16.srt	00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:06.169	Second one is the focus attention on a particular sound or you can say the noise cancellation.
16.srt	00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:13.589	If you understand, if you study the radar signal processing in electronics, you know the how the clutter noise is rejected or kind of things.
16.srt	00:12:14.089 --> 00:12:21.759	So, if I have two ears help human being to attention or focus on a particular sound.
16.srt	00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:36.279	If in this class there is a five people are talking together even at the five people are talking and their audio level is almost equal I can attend I can make attends my attention to a particular student speaking.
16.srt	00:12:37.109 --> 00:12:44.189	So, that means, I can focus on a particular sound that is one of the biggest property in human perception.
16.srt	00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:51.719	The I can easily cancel the noise or the what is the definition of a noise unwanted signal is nothing but a noise.
16.srt	00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.939	So, the suppose I want to pass I want to listen the student A sound.
16.srt	00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.110	So, student B produce sound is noise to that.
16.srt	00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:07.629	So, I can easily ignore the student B's voice and perceive the student A voice.
16.srt	00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:14.519	So, I can easily focus on a particular sound that is also because we have a two ears.
16.srt	00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:22.329	Now, once you put your headphone inside the ears then localization is.
16.srt	00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:24.809	within the headphone, it is not outside.
16.srt	00:13:25.259 --> 00:13:28.470	Once you put the headphone, sound is producing in there only.
16.srt	00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:34.519	So, the whatever the sound here is perceived, the localization happen in the headphone only.
16.srt	00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.299	So, there is a sound localization issue.
16.srt	00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:44.549	Now, if I come that I want to make the auditory model, auditory system model.
16.srt	00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:57.350	So, I can say whole auditory system model, it include sound the acoustical signal to normal conversion, and perception of that nerve signal by the brain.
16.srt	00:13:58.679 --> 00:14:07.460	So, I can say human auditory system or you can say human perception of sound I want to model.
16.srt	00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:23.889	Now, if I say want to model it how can I model because a human being is perceive the sound I cannot measure every and each and every point what is happening in the signal level and I cannot do that.
16.srt	00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:29.590	So, I can think let us the human sound perception is a black box.
16.srt	00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.360	Now, how do you define how do you how do you find out a black box model property of a system?
16.srt	00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:44.399	Suppose I have a system I do not know anything this is black box I do not know system property system thing nothing.
16.srt	00:14:45.179 --> 00:14:46.179	Now, how do you determine?
16.srt	00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:55.500	We excited the system with a particular signal or known signal then try to find out the.
16.srt	00:14:55.909 --> 00:15:10.840	So, let us I give an example I do not know the system if I put 2 it gives output 4, if I put 3 it gives output 9, if I give 4 it gives output 16.
16.srt	00:15:12.289 --> 00:15:25.799	If I able to observe this behavior then if I able to plot 2 then 4 then 3 then 9 then I can know from the plot the behavior of the.
16.srt	00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.329	this black box.
16.srt	00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:31.199	So, that is nothing but I can say this is nothing but a square.
16.srt	00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.990	So, X A square if X is the input Y is the output Y equal to X A square.
16.srt	00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:44.850	We can derive this system property from observing the known input what is the behavior.
16.srt	00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.299	Same black box model can be applied in human auditory system or human speech perception.
16.srt	00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:57.960	Suppose I apply a particular frequency sound with a particular intensity.
16.srt	00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:01.399	then I want to observe the human perception.
16.srt	00:16:02.119 --> 00:16:13.799	So, this is a you can say the physiological observation and this is the this is not a physiological of this is a physical input and physical output, but here I cannot get the physical output.
16.srt	00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:30.999	So, I can say here I can give a physical input which is nothing, but a sound acoustical sound and I wonder why I observe the physiological observation and try to correlate what kind of stimulus This is stimulus only input signal.
16.srt	00:16:31.459 --> 00:16:36.639	What kind of stimulus, what kind of physiological response is produced?
16.srt	00:16:38.469 --> 00:16:41.839	Then try to find out what is this black box?
16.srt	00:16:42.109 --> 00:16:44.389	How human being perceive the sound?
16.srt	00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:46.319	So, what I said?
16.srt	00:16:47.109 --> 00:16:59.729	I excited the this black box with a different kind of known stimulus and then I have to find out the physiological observation of human.
16.srt	00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:15.519	and then try to correlate what kind of stimulus producing what kind of observation and try to draw a conclusion what kind of processing is done by the human being.
16.srt	00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:27.759	So, that is why if you say there is a two dimension of sound parameter one is called physical dimension another is called perceptual dimension.
16.srt	00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:29.909	So, let us give an example.
16.srt	00:17:30.439 --> 00:18:00.349	intensity intensity and of a acoustics wave I can easily measure you can know I is equal to nothing but a p square by 2 rho c rho and c is the density and c is the velocity of the sound rho p is the pressure wave amplitude of the pressure wave then I can say intensity is nothing but a p square by 2 rho c. So, I can measure the sound intensity you can say the sound intensity measure my decibel I will come d b meter.
16.srt	00:18:00.659 --> 00:18:03.009	I can easily measure the intensity of a sound.
16.srt	00:18:04.239 --> 00:18:11.649	But once I say loudness, once I say loudness, this sound is louder than the previous sound.
16.srt	00:18:11.949 --> 00:18:17.609	It does not mean the intensity of the first sound is twice than the previous sound.
16.srt	00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:30.769	If I say this sound is twice louder than the previous sound, then I cannot say the current sound is not 2 i or previous or if the previous sound is i, it is 2 i.
16.srt	00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:38.769	The perception of loudness is human perception, but intensity is a physical parameter.
16.srt	00:18:40.059 --> 00:18:55.769	So, perception, so there is two dimension, one is called physical dimension, where I can directly measure the quantity, measure the parameters, directly measure the parameter, velocity, frequency, all are directly measurable.
16.srt	00:18:57.079 --> 00:19:04.239	But if I say loudness is a human behavior, physiological behavior of a human.
16.srt	00:19:04.569 --> 00:19:19.250	So, I stimulus or stimulate the human being by intensity and I want to observe that his behavior then observation behavior is called loudness and input is called intensity.
16.srt	00:19:19.869 --> 00:19:24.529	So, there is a physical dimension and there is a perceptual dimension.
16.srt	00:19:24.659 --> 00:19:28.009	So, I will come details on that physical dimension and perceptual by dimension.
16.srt	00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.329	Now, let us start with the physiology or you can say the anatomy of human ears.
16.srt	00:19:35.209 --> 00:19:43.659	some sort of a what is there in human ears if you see this is a color nice pictures that there is a human being human ears.
16.srt	00:19:43.769 --> 00:19:50.879	So, there is a you can say the outer ear which is this one only if you see this one is the outer ear.
16.srt	00:19:51.499 --> 00:19:53.039	So, this is called panna.
16.srt	00:19:54.249 --> 00:19:55.459	So, what is the function of this panna?
16.srt	00:19:56.729 --> 00:20:01.889	If you see if the sound wave is coming in this room in a medium air in a medium.
16.srt	00:20:05.159 --> 00:20:13.099	Now, if I put a like that if a sound wave is coming in this medium, if I put a area here, then sound wave will be strike here.
16.srt	00:20:15.189 --> 00:20:23.629	Now, if the intensity of the sound wave is I, then what is the total power of the acoustical wave which is strike in this plate?
16.srt	00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:31.669	If the area of the plate is A, then I can say their power or force is equal to I into A.
16.srt	00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:48.700	So, I can say The principle of the Pana, so working principle of the Pana is the or you can say that the work of the Pana is that it collect that acoustical wave and channelize it to the middle ear.
16.srt	00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:57.730	So, if I increase the Pana, the channelized power will acoustical power will be increases.
16.srt	00:20:58.069 --> 00:21:03.420	That is why sometime when you want to listen the very low sound, we put our hand in here.
16.srt	00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.619	Once we put our hand in here.
16.srt	00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.590	it increase the panna area.
16.srt	00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:12.410	So, more acoustical signal is channelized to there.
16.srt	00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:19.819	Some if you see the rabbits to listen the sound rabbit can move his panna, we cannot move my panna.
16.srt	00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:22.590	So, that is why we have a head movement.
16.srt	00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:32.140	So, I once I want to listen the sound I can listen I can rotate the head, but if you see the rabbit can rotate their panna to the direction of the sound.
16.srt	00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.759	So, the panna work is that it should channelize the acoustical wave.
16.srt	00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.630	power to the middle ear that is the working of the panna.
16.srt	00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:54.110	So, if it is large more acoustical wave will be entered, if it is small the area if the reduce then a power will be reduced.
16.srt	00:21:54.950 --> 00:22:01.030	So, that is the working principle of the outer panna outer ear or panna pina you can say the pina or panna.
16.srt	00:22:11.509 --> 00:22:14.309	Then there is a middle ear, middle ear is what middle ear that acoustical signal passes in the middle ear and middle ear consists of a membrane and bone.
16.srt	00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:22.440	I will come to the what is the work and then inner ear has an cochlear if you see there is an cochlear.
16.srt	00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:41.289	Now so, you can auditory canal this is called auditory canal middle ear auditory canal acoustic wave is coming in here now it is strike in this membrane once this acoustic wave is strike in the membrane it produce the vibration that vibration.
16.srt	00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:47.150	transmitted to the cochlea by a conduction process.
16.srt	00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:59.550	So, there is a bone and that bone this acts as a mechanical resonator or mechanic you can say not resonator you can amplifier you can mechanically amplify the sound and transmit to the cochlea.
16.srt	00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:22.620	If you see the guitar not that electronics guitar if you see there is a mechanical amplifier or you can say resonator you can say the resonator that if it is not that is not there if I strike the sound will be less, but if it is there then it acts on mechanical resonator then it is the sound is larger.
16.srt	00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:30.860	So, that is the effect in here also that is this acts on mechanical kind of things and that transfer the sound to the cochlea.
16.srt	00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.750	So, that vibration goes to the cochlea.
16.srt	00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.130	Now, cochlea so I am not reading the slide you can read the slide.
16.srt	00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.320	So, inner ear is the cochlea.
16.srt	00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.770	So, this is the semicircular canal and there is a cochlea.
16.srt	00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:55.660	So, you know that the ear has two functions, this whole system has two functions, one is balance the body and another one is the listening.
16.srt	00:23:56.010 --> 00:24:07.870	So, the inside the cochlea there is a basilar membrane which is responsible for listening the sound and this semicircular canal, so the cochlea is filled of liquid.
16.srt	00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.780	So, you can say that it is a nothing but a packet of liquid.
16.srt	00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.970	So, if I vibrate that outside wall of the liquid.
16.srt	00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:23.620	then what will happen that vibration will transfer to the liquid and liquid will spread the vibration to everywhere.
16.srt	00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:32.720	So, that is the mechanism for inner ear to perceive the sound and this semicircular canal is full of liquid that acts the body balance.
16.srt	00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:51.620	So, this is nothing but you can say the if you see that the that some sometimes when we are balancing or you can say leveling some floor we use the water balance that to make a tube with full of water and then water level balancing we said whether the plane is correct or not where is the slope or kind of things.
16.srt	00:24:52.970 --> 00:25:07.640	this thing is used we have two semicircular canal in two side and which is responsible for find out the body balance like that water balance same things is in here also.
16.srt	00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:19.930	Now in inner ear so this is the basic description of the how human being what the function of the every part of the human ear now I go to the details.
16.srt	00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.620	So, this is physiological we understand.
16.srt	00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:44.520	Now, in engineering model, so I should know what kind of action or what kind of things is happen in PINA that is outer ear and what kind of response is happen in the middle ear and the finally, the inner ear.
16.srt	00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:50.880	So, if I see the frequency response of the outer ear that is the PINA.
16.srt	00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.560	So, PINA if you see that it is not channelize all frequency same amplitude.
16.srt	00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:58.560	I can say.
16.srt	00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:07.130	So, what I say the outer here if I see the frequency this axis is the frequency and this is the response in dB.
16.srt	00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:24.250	So, all frequency 0 dB is not same intensity or you can say that 0 dB of 0 forget about the 0 hertz let us 0.3 kilohertz that means, let us 300 hertz.
16.srt	00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.350	So, 300 hertz sound of let us.
16.srt	00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:47.030	0.5 dB not less than 0.2 dB and 1 kilohertz sound of 0.5 dB will be the same response because it is amplify or you can say that amplification of the power or I say the or all frequency by the outer ear is not same.
16.srt	00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:56.400	Similarly, amplification or you can say the frequency response of the middle ear is not flat throughout the frequency, it also different response.
16.srt	00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:09.440	If I combine these two middle and inner not middle and outer ear the combined response is come as a red color.
16.srt	00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:18.830	So, I can say human ear is not equal sensitive to all frequency.
16.srt	00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:29.670	So, I can say we are not equally sensitive or I can say let us 5 dB sound of 100 Hertz.
16.srt	00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:43.960	and 5 dB sound of 2 kilohertz is not produced same intensity sensation or loudness sensation by the human in our human brain.
16.srt	00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:50.520	So, this may be louder compared to this because of this response.
16.srt	00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:58.880	So, if I inverted this curve, if I inverted this curve, the curve will come like this.
16.srt	00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:19.360	So, all if it is this is the frequency, this is the So, all frequency has not equal response in case of human ear that is the frequency response of human ear that is the frequency response of a microphone.
16.srt	00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:34.280	If it is flat for 300 hertz to 3 kilo 10 kilo hertz that means the microphone can produce the output or equal sensitive the frequency between the 300 hertz to.
16.srt	00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:43.380	10 kilohertz, but other frequency the conversion from acoustical signal to electrical signal is very low either very low or almost 0.
16.srt	00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:50.600	Similarly, human ear is not sensitive or intensity sensitive to all frequency equally.
16.srt	00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:57.010	So, the may be here is 1 kilohertz may be after 5 kilohertz it also increasing.
16.srt	00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:06.520	So, 5 dB of 100 hertz, 5 dB of 2 kilohertz the intensity perception by the human being.
16.srt	00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:07.390	will be different.
16.srt	00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:16.870	That is why we say because of the this combine curve I will come this is called the threshold of hearing I will come later on that one.
16.srt	00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:26.220	So, now I am not a describing that function of cochlear and all those things you can read this this is that this slide that is nothing is there.
16.srt	00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.920	So, I can say this is the schematic representation.
16.srt	00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:37.220	So, PINAA collect that acoustical signal channelized to auditory canal and media layer.
16.srt	00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:44.970	that convert that acoustical signal to a mechanical vibration and that mechanical vibration transferred to the cochlear.
16.srt	00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.910	Inside the cochlear, there is a basilar membrane.
16.srt	00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.080	So, this is apex and this is the beginning.
16.srt	00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.510	So, this is the beginning of the cochlear, this is the apex of the cochlear.
16.srt	00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:07.120	So, inside the cochlear, there is a basilar membrane which is responsible for speech conversion of that mechanical motion to normal signal.
16.srt	00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.840	So, how do we how it is done it?
16.srt	00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:30.080	So, let us I am not discussing here let us in the next class I will discuss how the basilar membrane is converted or you can responsible for or convert that vibrate or motion mechanical vibration to the normal signal.
16.srt	00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:30.990	Thank you.
14.srt	00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:18.289	So, last class we derived that junction effect.
14.srt	00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:32.369	If I consider the vocal track is nothing, but a junction of several tube and if the cross sectional area across the tube is different what should be the junction effect we have discussed.
14.srt	00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:36.289	and I cut this tube in n number of section.
14.srt	00:00:36.640 --> 00:01:04.239	So, the length of the each section x is equal length l by n. So, tau is nothing but a tau is nothing but a x by c. So, it is nothing but a tau is nothing but a x is nothing but a l by n c. So, if I have a tube of 17.5 second, let us say 5 centimeter tube long.
14.srt	00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:30.789	So, I have a tube And if I divided the tube in n equal to 10 junction, then the tau is nothing but a 17.5 centimeter divided by n into c, c is the speed of the sound that much of delay is required ok. Now I come if my tube is n number of tube is there.
14.srt	00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.250	So, there will be a n minus 1 are the junction 1 to n minus 1 number of junction.
14.srt	00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.879	So, I can draw the equation like this way.
14.srt	00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:56.419	Let this is UGN, then the first junction, second junction, dot dot dot, nth n minus 1 junction and this is the and if you see the last one is the boundary condition at left and this one is the boundary condition at rightist.
14.srt	00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:01.129	So, it is RG, it is half of 1 plus RG, it is minus RL, 1 plus RL.
14.srt	00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:10.969	I can draw the n tube equivalent signal diagram, signal flow diagram and each delay is represented by z to the power.
14.srt	00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:41.069	1 minus 1 ok. Now, if this is my tube let us U G n is nothing but a delta signal delta n ok delta n delta signal or delta n. If it is delta signal then output if this is the my signal flow diagram then output I should get V A t at the output is nothing but a V 0 delta t minus delta n.
14.srt	00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:56.769	tau plus k equal to 1 to infinity B k delta T minus n tau minus 2 k 2 tau, why?
14.srt	00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:07.789	So, if you see if I have a tube with n number of junction of length let us n the n section of junction.
14.srt	00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.169	So, each section create a delay tau.
14.srt	00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:28.679	So, n section create a delay n tau, but that is the first first signal first delta that is why b 0 into delta n, but after all the signal the after the first round that that delay will be there.
14.srt	00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.429	So, what is the delay 2 tau is the round tip delay.
14.srt	00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.299	So, this is the first arrival of the signal second will be arrival due to the back propagation.
14.srt	00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.269	So, there will be a 2 tau delay.
14.srt	00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:47.419	So, earliest arrival is n tau which is n number of tube each section delayed by tau.
14.srt	00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.419	Next signal will come by 2 tau delay.
14.srt	00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.949	So, I can say next signal will be integer multiple of 2 tau delay.
14.srt	00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:05.089	So, that is why I said 2 k sorry k 2 tau k into 2 tau k is the integer and 2 tau is the delay.
14.srt	00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:20.839	Now, if I consider to avoiding the alloysing of digitization process if I consider my sampling period t is equal to 2 tau.
14.srt	00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:43.459	So, my sampling period t is equal to 2 tau what I am saying suppose I want to create a band limited signal or less speech signal whose maximum frequency is 500 hertz 5 kilohertz or 5 kilohertz let us say 5 kilohertz is the maximum bandwidth.
14.srt	00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:45.069	is the sampling frequency?
14.srt	00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:46.589	10 kilohertz.
14.srt	00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:50.849	10 kilohertz is the sampling frequency.
14.srt	00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:58.019	So, band limited is 5 kilohertz, Nyquist criteria is 10 kilohertz.
14.srt	00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:09.159	So, if I want to reach the Nyquist criteria in this 2 tau delay, so 2 tau must be equal to the sample period.
14.srt	00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.109	So, 2 tau is equal to sample period.
14.srt	00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:15.499	If 2 tau is equal to sample period.
14.srt	00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:30.119	Then, how do I derive this v z if I consider this is a z domain v z which is nothing but a u l z divided by u g z and each z to the power minus 1.
14.srt	00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:32.729	Now, z to the power minus 1 is single sample delay.
14.srt	00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:35.899	Now, my sample delay is t equal to 2 tau.
14.srt	00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:41.039	So, I can say instead of z to the power minus 1 it will z to the power minus half.
14.srt	00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:49.979	So, all the z value will be replaced by z to the power minus half z to the power minus half z to the power minus half z to the power minus half.
14.srt	00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:50.779	So, I get this.
14.srt	00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.989	signal flow diagram.
14.srt	00:05:52.519 --> 00:06:08.109	Once I get the signal flow diagram, can I derive the v z transfer function of the tube which is nothing but a output which is u z u l z divided by u g z z domain.
14.srt	00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:15.129	So, u g z I know it is nothing but a impulse or got all response.
14.srt	00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:16.849	Now, what is u l z?
14.srt	00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.500	So, I could derive this transfer function.
14.srt	00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:21.399	So, how do I derive it?
14.srt	00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:24.600	using a signal flow diagram I can derived it.
14.srt	00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.209	So, let us there is a procedure for derived it.
14.srt	00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:39.240	So, let us use some procedure or some simplest this may be the simplest form procedure for derive your transfer function of v z which is nothing but u l z divided by u j z.
14.srt	00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:40.670	How do we derived it?
14.srt	00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:53.430	If I consider each one of the junction is acts as a latex if you see the symmetrical this is r 1 this is r 2 this is r n minus 1, but all are symmetrical.
14.srt	00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.650	Now, let us I draw in here because you have to understanding if I draw it here it will be very clear to you.
14.srt	00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:18.270	Now, let us this is nothing but a my u g n coming to the first junction let us first junction is here which is nothing but a I will first draw the junction and then I write down the signal flow.
14.srt	00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:24.180	So, this is this way this is this way this is this way and this is this way.
14.srt	00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.000	So, this I will write in the red pen.
14.srt	00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:53.670	So, this is nothing but a 1 minus r 1, this is nothing but a 1 plus r 1, this is r 1, this is minus r 1 ok. Now, I have a u g, so I have a u g is here, u g n is coming to here and then there is a terminal at glottis which is nothing but a.
14.srt	00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:57.080	So, there will be z to the power.
14.srt	00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:27.389	So, let us there will be z to the power minus 1 delay z to the power minus half here will be delay z to the power minus half and this will be R g and this will be 1 plus R g divided by 2 and then the same junction I can continue there will be a delay.
14.srt	00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:37.039	z to the power minus half, there will be a delay z to the power minus half and again there will be a junction.
14.srt	00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:59.259	So, junction let us signal flow diagram this is this, this is this, this is this, again this will be 1 minus r 2, this will be 1 plus r 2, this is r 2, this is minus r 2.
14.srt	00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:21.750	Then, I can say there will be again delay again delay z to the power minus half z to the power minus half ok. Again there will be a junction let us this is nth junction n minus 1 junction there will be a junction this is the let us n minus 1 junction.
14.srt	00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.309	So, there will be lot of junction in here.
14.srt	00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:31.669	So, this if it is n minus 1 junction this is 1 plus R n minus 1 this is 1 minus R n minus 1.
14.srt	00:09:32.059 --> 00:09:41.009	this is R n minus 1, this is R n. And at the end leap there will be a boundary condition.
14.srt	00:09:41.319 --> 00:10:05.159	So, there will be a z to the power minus 1, then I put the boundary condition which is like this z to the power minus half, z to the power minus half and this is nothing but a minus R L, this is 1 plus R L, I get U L n. This is the output.
14.srt	00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:15.859	So, I have to find out u if it is z domain then u z u l z divided by u g z that I have to find out.
14.srt	00:10:16.609 --> 00:10:17.479	So, how do you find out?
14.srt	00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:20.719	Let us calculate let us calculate stage by stage.
14.srt	00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:35.809	So, if I say any u so, I you know that u k plus 1 plus z is nothing but a 1 plus r k that we have already derived 1 plus r k.
14.srt	00:10:36.299 --> 00:10:58.859	z to the power minus half u k z u k plus z plus 1 z plus r k into u k plus 1 minus z that we have derived last day u k plus 1 z the volume velocity which is injected in the k plus 1 tube is nothing but this one.
14.srt	00:11:07.689 --> 00:11:08.629	From here I can find out what is u k plus z is nothing but in term of k plus 1 tube.
14.srt	00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:27.959	So, it is nothing but a, so z to the power minus half, if I say it will come z to the power plus half divided by 1 plus r k into u k plus 1 plus z minus this will become this side.
14.srt	00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:42.980	So, minus r k z to the power half divided by 1 plus r k u k plus 1 minus z.
14.srt	00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:52.259	So, this is you can say u k plus z u k plus z at k th u u k plus z is nothing but at this one.
14.srt	00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:59.919	Similarly, I can find out what is u k minus z.
14.srt	00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:03.769	So, what is u k minus z?
14.srt	00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:40.829	Already we have done u k minus z is nothing but a u k minus z is nothing but a minus r k z to the power minus half divided by 1 plus r k u k plus 1 plus z z plus z to the power minus half 1 plus r k u k plus 1 minus z. I can do that.
14.srt	00:12:41.809 --> 00:12:42.450	k plus 1.
14.srt	00:12:42.700 --> 00:13:04.289	So, I this I I represent u k plus z u k minus z in term of u k plus 1 z u k u k plus u k plus 1 plus z u k plus 1 minus z ok. Now once I do that then if you see here this is my u k plus equation and this is my u k minus equation.
14.srt	00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:12.519	Once I do that now if you see that if I say matrix this this this all are u k 1.
14.srt	00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:22.000	So, u 1, u 1 plus, u 1 minus, u 1 minus z, u 1 plus, u 1 minus z, you can see that blue and yellow.
14.srt	00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.139	So, those are the equation.
14.srt	00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:32.659	Now, if I say let us u k is nothing but a consist of 2 plus u k plus z and u k minus z.
14.srt	00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:47.750	Whole u k is nothing but a forward wave and backward wave and from here I can write u k is nothing but a r k into u k plus 1.
14.srt	00:13:50.329 --> 00:14:08.019	If I write that, if you see this is the two equation u k minus and u k plus u k. So, if it is u k plus 1 is nothing but a u k plus 1 plus z and u k plus 1 minus z ok.
14.srt	00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:10.699	So, this has to be multiplied by this matrix equation.
14.srt	00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:11.939	What is the matrix?
14.srt	00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:16.299	z to the power half divided by 1 plus r k.
14.srt	00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:48.209	minus r k into z to the power minus half z to the power half divided by 1 plus r k and another one is minus minus r k z to the power minus half divided by 1 plus r k and z to the power minus half divided by 1 plus r k. So, those coefficient I write in matrix form if I write this matrix form.
14.srt	00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:49.679	half.
14.srt	00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:57.750	Then I can say I simplify this matrix z to the power minus half 1 plus R k I can write down here.
14.srt	00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:05.909	So, it is 1 minus R k divided by this one 1 minus R k 1 minus R k minus R k z to the power minus 1 z to the power minus 1.
14.srt	00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:16.039	Now, if I see this matrix is R k cap and this whole matrix q k is equal to R k. So, I can write R k is nothing but a z to the power minus half.
14.srt	00:15:18.599 --> 00:15:33.539	So, q k is equal to 1, I can say is nothing but a R 1 R 2 R 3 dot dot dot R n into u n minus 1 sorry u n plus 1.
14.srt	00:15:37.489 --> 00:15:50.419	I can write k varies from 1 to n let us if it is k varies from 1 to n u 1 is nothing but a R 1 R 2 R 3 dot dot dot R n into u n plus 1.
14.srt	00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:58.869	Now, if you see that this diagram there is a n minus 1 symmetry junction.
14.srt	00:15:59.489 --> 00:16:03.109	So, this is 1, 2 and this is n minus 1.
14.srt	00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:11.439	Here junction is not symmetry in R L cases only problem is that there is a no backward wave in here.
14.srt	00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:14.329	Let us I put a backward wave with 0.
14.srt	00:16:15.229 --> 00:16:20.279	So, there will be a I can put a backward wave here which is nothing but a 0.
14.srt	00:16:23.289 --> 00:16:40.819	So, it is 1 minus R n this is 1 plus R n 1 plus R l let us R l is equal to R n. So, it is 1 plus R n and this is minus R n if this is plus R n this is minus R n I can write I can write.
14.srt	00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:45.089	So, see this here in the slides if you see I added this block.
14.srt	00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:52.769	So, now there is a n number of block instead of n minus 1 block I can get n number of block.
14.srt	00:16:53.239 --> 00:16:56.039	with input here backward wave is 0.
14.srt	00:16:56.249 --> 00:17:14.199	So, I can write u n plus 1 u n plus 1 is equal to nothing but a u l z and 0 because here u l z is only 0 is added with u l z.
14.srt	00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.729	So, u l z plus and minus wave.
14.srt	00:17:28.259 --> 00:17:34.199	So, I can write it is nothing but a 1 0 u l z and u 1 equal to R 1 R 2 R 3 dot dot dot dot R n u n minus 1.
14.srt	00:17:34.439 --> 00:17:45.629	So, it is nothing but a R 1 R 2 R 3 dot dot dot dot R n into 1 0 u l z.
14.srt	00:17:45.629 --> 00:17:49.699	Now, u 1 I get.
14.srt	00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:56.679	Now, I have to find out what is the relation between u g z and u 1 z.
14.srt	00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.839	So, I have to consider the boundary condition.
14.srt	00:18:00.339 --> 00:18:01.740	at the grottist.
14.srt	00:18:02.369 --> 00:18:06.019	So, what is U g relation between the U g z and U 1 z?
14.srt	00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:26.690	U g z so, U 1 plus z is equal to 0.5 1 plus R g 1 plus R g U g z plus R g U g U 1 minus z I can write.
14.srt	00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.750	So, I can say U g z.
14.srt	00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:44.980	is equal to 2 by 1 plus R g. So, 0.5 means or you can write 0.5 by 1 plus R g. So, 2 this is 2 by 1 plus R g because this is half only.
14.srt	00:18:45.509 --> 00:19:00.919	2 by 1 plus R g u 1 plus z minus 2 R g by 1 plus R g u 1 minus z.
14.srt	00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:22.369	So, I can say it is nothing but a 2 coefficient 2 by 1 plus R g 1 and another is 2 R g divided by 1 plus R g into u 1 z.
14.srt	00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:33.689	So, u g z is nothing but a 2 by 1 plus R g this constant it is nothing but a 1 this is minus I think this is minus.
14.srt	00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:38.869	So, it is minus R g into U 1 z.
14.srt	00:19:41.069 --> 00:19:49.459	So, I can write U 1 is equal to R 1 R 2 R 3 R 4 R n into 1 0 U L z.
14.srt	00:19:49.459 --> 00:20:05.879	So, I can write U g z is equal to R 1 R 2 R 3 sorry U g z equal to 2 by 1 plus R g 1 minus R g. So, instead of U 1 z I can write R 1 R 2.
14.srt	00:20:06.089 --> 00:20:15.889	R 2 R 3 dot dot dot R n 1 0 U L z.
14.srt	00:20:15.889 --> 00:20:36.349	Now, I get U g z divided by U L z is equal to 2 by 1 plus R g 1 minus R g R 1 R 2 R 3 dot dot dot dot R n.
14.srt	00:20:36.899 --> 00:20:40.699	into 1 0 I can say that.
14.srt	00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:45.889	So, which is nothing but a 1 by v z 1 by the transfer function.
14.srt	00:20:46.459 --> 00:20:53.759	So, v z I want to find out v z which v z is equal to u l z divided by u g z.
14.srt	00:20:54.269 --> 00:20:55.979	So, it is nothing but a 1 by v z.
14.srt	00:20:56.259 --> 00:21:07.369	So, 1 by v z I can write in term of 2 by 1 plus R g 1 minus R g R 1 R 2 R 3 R n 1 0 ok. Now, if I write that.
14.srt	00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:21.229	Then, if I put the value of R 1 and R 2, the equation will become 2 by 1 plus R g 1 minus R g z to the power n by 2.
14.srt	00:21:21.589 --> 00:21:24.459	So, if you see the R k is z to the power half.
14.srt	00:21:25.499 --> 00:21:39.759	So, I can say if it is n, so it is z to the power n by 2 k equal to 1 to n 1 by 1 plus R k. R 1 z to the power minus half for R 2 z to the power minus z to the power half.
14.srt	00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:57.779	for R 3, z to the power, if it is R n product of z to the power half, z to the power half, z to the power half, so n number of, so it is nothing but z to the power n by 2 k equal to 1 to n 1 plus 1 plus R k, k equal to 1 to n cap R k cap, so R k is like the matrix is this and 1 0.
14.srt	00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:09.039	So, now if I say my n is equal to 2, then I can find out the impulse risk or transfer function of the tube model.
14.srt	00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:10.970	So, if I simplify this thing.
14.srt	00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:13.950	for 2 tube.
14.srt	00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:23.480	If I consider that my length of tube whole vocal cord is vocal track is simulated using 2 tube.
14.srt	00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:26.950	So, if it is 2 tube, so n is equal to 2.
14.srt	00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:36.640	If I put n equal to 2, then 1 by v z will become 2 by 1 plus R g will be same.
14.srt	00:22:37.509 --> 00:22:40.420	This will be 1 minus R g will be there.
14.srt	00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.029	So, there is no effect on here.
14.srt	00:22:42.609 --> 00:22:50.439	Now, is z to the power n by 2, n equal to 2, so 2 by 2.
14.srt	00:22:50.819 --> 00:22:58.759	Then, product of k equal to 1 to n, k equal to 1 to n means n equal to 2.
14.srt	00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:09.240	So, instead of k equal to 1 to n, I can write 1 by 1 plus R 1 into 1 by 1 plus R 2.
14.srt	00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:12.799	Then, I can write k equal to 2 in this equation.
14.srt	00:23:13.289 --> 00:23:18.139	So, k equal to 2 k equal to 1 1 minus r 1 1.
14.srt	00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:38.899	So, I can write 1 minus r 1 another 1 is minus r 1 z to the power minus 1 z to the power minus 1 into 1 minus r 2 minus r 2 z to the power minus 1 z to the power minus 1 then 1 0.
14.srt	00:23:43.809 --> 00:24:04.139	If I evaluate it, it will come So, z to the power half z, so z 2 z divided by 1 plus R g into 1 minus R g, this will be 1 by 1 plus R 1 into 1 plus R 2, then I can matrix multiply this in this one.
14.srt	00:24:04.429 --> 00:24:13.779	So, this one is 1 plus R 1 R 2 z to the power minus 1, 1 minus R 1 z to the power minus 1.
14.srt	00:24:14.109 --> 00:24:17.269	minus r 2 z to the power minus 2.
14.srt	00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:26.179	If I evaluate, so this matrix will be 1 0, I can say first evaluate these two, then come to the here this side.
14.srt	00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:42.539	So, if I write down the equation, then whole equation 1 by v z is nothing but a, I can multiply this thing 1 plus r 1 1 plus r 2 and this thing I can multiply together and I can find out.
14.srt	00:24:46.429 --> 00:25:13.989	So, v z is nothing but 1 by v z and then v z will becomes if I derive these things and then the v z will become v z will be 0.51 plus R g into 1 plus R 1 into 1 plus R 2 z to the power minus 1 divided by 1 plus R 1 R 2.
14.srt	00:25:15.089 --> 00:25:26.219	plus R 1 R g z to the power minus 1 plus R 2 R g z to the power minus 2.
14.srt	00:25:27.349 --> 00:25:31.489	This will be the two tube vocal track model.
14.srt	00:25:33.159 --> 00:25:40.699	If you see this transfer function, I have a 0 at origin z to the power minus 1, but I have a two pole.
14.srt	00:25:40.699 --> 00:25:43.329	This is second order equation.
14.srt	00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:45.649	So, I have a second to second order.
14.srt	00:25:45.879 --> 00:25:48.379	we can say 2 pole or it is a second order equation.
14.srt	00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:58.139	So, I have a single 0 for 2 tube model, I have a 0 at center 1 0 and 2 pole.
14.srt	00:25:59.709 --> 00:26:02.449	So, at origin 1 0 and 2 pole.
14.srt	00:26:02.649 --> 00:26:12.919	So, if I have a n tube model, I can say n by 2 0 at origin and nth this equation become n order.
14.srt	00:26:13.639 --> 00:26:16.269	So, I can say there will be n number of pole.
14.srt	00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:19.309	this equation become nth order.
14.srt	00:26:19.609 --> 00:26:30.649	So, I can say this whole v z can be say this is all 0 are in center and this is all pole model.
14.srt	00:26:32.339 --> 00:26:42.739	So, I can write v z is nothing but a g by d z where d z is nothing but a pole model.
14.srt	00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:59.179	So, if it is nth order so, it is nothing but a 1 plus k equal to 1 to n alpha k z to the power minus k. So, kth pole will nth pole will be the n number of pole will be there.
14.srt	00:26:59.609 --> 00:27:09.719	So, I can write down the equation 1 plus k equal to 1 to n alpha k z to the power minus k and n by 2 0 at origin.
14.srt	00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:18.729	So, instead of writing this the all 0 model z to the power minus 1 minus half in here z to the power minus half in here.
14.srt	00:27:18.969 --> 00:27:31.919	I can write this dz in a signal flow diagram as a all pole model and z equal to this vz z to the power minus all pole model then it will be z to the power minus n by 2.
14.srt	00:27:33.079 --> 00:27:36.359	So, I can write down the signal flow diagram in all pole model.
14.srt	00:27:36.869 --> 00:27:47.439	So, I can say mathematically it is proved that a vocal track transfer function can be simplified as a all pole digital filter.
14.srt	00:27:49.229 --> 00:27:51.379	All pole digital filter I can simplify it.
14.srt	00:27:51.699 --> 00:28:06.869	So, if I able to simplify all pole digital filter and if I know alpha k, if I know alpha k which is nothing but in term of R 1 R 2 and the R 1 R 2 R g I have to know.
14.srt	00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:08.769	So, what is R 1 R 2?
14.srt	00:28:08.889 --> 00:28:10.229	All are reflection coefficient.
14.srt	00:28:10.609 --> 00:28:14.649	If I know all reflection coefficient, I can simulate this dz.
14.srt	00:28:15.609 --> 00:28:21.859	So, it is impossible to implement this dz using digital filter.
14.srt	00:28:23.999 --> 00:28:50.229	So, now I can say dz is nothing but a, there is a error in the slides please correct it, dz is nothing but a 1 plus k equal to 1 to n alpha k z to the power minus k. So, let us Rg is equal to 1 that means, there is no glottal impedance Rg is equal to 1.
14.srt	00:28:50.739 --> 00:28:51.319	Thank you.
15.srt	00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:18.589	So,we have derived thatall pole model for vocal track.
15.srt	00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:26.579	So, V z is nothing, but a I can say the g by dz ok.
15.srt	00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:50.429	So, where dz is nothing, but a 1 plus k sorry summation of k equal to 1 to n alpha k z to the power minus k. Now, if you see the second for the two tube model the equation v z is nothing but a 0.5 1 plus R g 1 plus R 1.
15.srt	00:00:50.429 --> 00:01:02.480	So, for two tube model v z is n equal to 2 n equal to 2 is two tube model 0.5 1 plus R g 1 plus R 1.
15.srt	00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:23.719	1 plus R 2 into z to the power minus 1 divided by I can say 1 plus R 1 R 2 R 1 R 2 R 1 R g into z to the power minus 1 plus R 2 R g z to the power minus 2.
15.srt	00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:35.020	So, this is for two tube model is nothing but a 1 plus R 1 R 2 plus R 1 R g.
15.srt	00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.359	z to the power minus 1 plus R 2 R g z to the power minus 2.
15.srt	00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:55.379	Now, if I say R g is equal to 1, if I say R g is equal to 1, total impedance is infinite, z g is equal to infinite, then R g equal to 1.
15.srt	00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:06.780	So, R g is nothing but a, you know that R g is R R t minus R g divided by R t plus R g or what was R g minus R t or R t minus R g.
15.srt	00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:21.569	R g minus R t. So, that is there in constant when we model in that boundary condition, when we model in boundary condition we said R g boundary condition modeling where here.
15.srt	00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:28.189	So, here I can say R g is nothing but a Z g minus Z d divided by Z g plus.
15.srt	00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:37.139	So, R g is nothing but a here I write capital R g let us consider small R g R g is Z g minus Z d divided by Z g.
15.srt	00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.519	plus Z d. If Z g is infinite, then R g is equal to 1.
15.srt	00:02:41.780 --> 00:03:02.419	Now, if I consider R g is equal to 1, then d z is nothing but a 1 plus R 1 R 2 plus R 1 z to the power minus 1 plus R 2 z to the power minus 2.
15.srt	00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.019	So, if it is nth order, if I can write that, if it is instead of 2 tube, it is n tube or I can say it is nothing but a.
15.srt	00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:17.829	1 plus r 1 1 plus r 1 r 2 r 1 z to the power minus 1 plus r 2 z to the power minus 2.
15.srt	00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:23.169	So, if I say that I can want to write down the recursive equation.
15.srt	00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.849	So, d 1 z if it is d 2 z.
15.srt	00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:41.169	So, d 1 z if I write d 1 z is nothing but a 1 plus r 1 z to the power minus 1 if r g is equal to 1.
15.srt	00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:59.829	1, d 2 z is 1 plus r 1 z to the power minus 1 plus r 1 r 2 z to the power minus 1 plus r 2 z to the power minus 2 that I have derived here z to the power minus 2.
15.srt	00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:08.579	Now, if I say this is nothing but a d 1 z 1 plus r 1 z to the power minus 1 is nothing but a d 1 z.
15.srt	00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:28.980	So, d 1 z d 1 z d 1 z d 1 z 2 z to the power minus 2 into d 1 z to the power minus 1. r 1 r 2 z to the power minus 1 plus r 2 z to the power minus 2.
15.srt	00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:42.069	This term can be written like this way r 2 z to the to the power minus 2 into d 1 z to the power minus 1, because d 1 z to the power minus 1 will be 1 plus r 1.
15.srt	00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.930	1 z to the power minus 1 instead of z.
15.srt	00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.520	So, z so, R 1 z into this one.
15.srt	00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.470	So, R 1 R 2 z to the power minus 1 and R 1 z.
15.srt	00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:00.120	So, this can be also written by d 0 z there is a no junction no nothing is there is 1.
15.srt	00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:12.520	So, it is nothing but a d 0 z into plus R 1 I can say z to the power minus 1 d 0.
15.srt	00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.290	z to the power minus 1.
15.srt	00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:27.460	Similarly, I can write down this way because this is nothing but a d 1 we put d 1 value and this will come same value in here.
15.srt	00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:42.670	Similarly, I can write d n z or d k z d n z I can write nth tube n number of tube this is nothing but a d n minus 1 z.
15.srt	00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:32.270	plus r 2 z to the power minus n d n minus 1 z to the power minus 1 or I can say d k z is nothing but a d k minus 1 z plus r 2 z to the power minus 1 d k minus 1 z to the power minus 1 which is same as if I write the equation dz is equal to 1 plus k equal to 1 to n alpha k z to the power minus k. Same way I can write.
15.srt	00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.730	So, this can be written as like this way.
15.srt	00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.440	So, if I write this one, if n is equal to number of section is equal to 10 and let us R n is equal to 1 load, but R n is equal to R L. So, let us load is R L is equal to 1.
15.srt	00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:03.630	So, no resistive load for low frequency R n is equal to R L which is equal to 1.
15.srt	00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:21.760	Now, I can say I can find out the what is the value of if I know that R n is equal to 1, then from that side left side this last R n is equal to 1.
15.srt	00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.670	So, I can find out R n minus 1.
15.srt	00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:54.080	I can implement the tube, digitally implement the tube or other hand if I know the signal which is coming out from the tube from there I can estimate the area function of different junction because if I know R, R is R n is nothing but a what is R k, R k is nothing but a a k plus 1 minus a k.
15.srt	00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:04.330	divided by a k plus 1 plus a k. So, a k a are the area cross sectional area function of the tube different tube.
15.srt	00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:16.660	So, if it is a 10 number of tube consists of the vocal track is model using a 10 number of tube last r n r n is equal to 1 last one is equal to 1.
15.srt	00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:43.070	Then I can find out a k. So, r n I know r n. So, this is r k. So, I know r n r n is equal to a n plus 1 minus a n divided by a n plus 1 plus a n. So, if I know the cross sectional area, then I can know the, decide the reflection coefficient and I can model the tube in digital domain.
15.srt	00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:56.140	On the other hand, if I know the speech signal and if I able to find out the value of reflection coefficient alpha k, in somehow I can able to find out the alpha k value, then I can find out the.
15.srt	00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.910	cross sectional area of the different tube.
15.srt	00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:05.560	I can give you one example from Rabindran Seyfert that is written there is a different cross sectional area for a vowel.
15.srt	00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.879	I think either vowel which vowel I do not know that there is a vowel.
15.srt	00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.620	So, this vowel area functions is written.
15.srt	00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:23.200	Either I know the area function I can generate the vowel if I know the vowel I can derive the area function ok.
15.srt	00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.470	So, how do I digitally implement this?
15.srt	00:09:28.289 --> 00:09:31.879	I want to digitally implement this tube.
15.srt	00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:46.009	So, I know I have to implement dz is nothing but a 1 plus k equal to 1 to n alpha k z to the power minus k. This equation I have to implement.
15.srt	00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.759	So, if I able to implement, how do I implement?
15.srt	00:09:50.049 --> 00:09:50.769	Very simple.
15.srt	00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:57.539	So, there is a u n, let us n u n n impulse.
15.srt	00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:27.940	1, then I have a output which is u l n. So, this will be simple delay by z to the power minus 1 alpha 1 and has to be added with here, then z to the power minus 2 alpha 2 added in here dot dot dot dot z to the power minus n alpha n added here.
15.srt	00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:40.769	So, I can implement in digital systems, I can implement it digital filter, nothing but a digital filter, the equation looks like a nothing but a digital filter.
15.srt	00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:47.610	So, I can easily implement it using that things that vocal track I can implement using digital domain.
15.srt	00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.690	So, now there is some concept poles of vocal track.
15.srt	00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.300	So, you know that poles all pole models of vocal track tube.
15.srt	00:10:58.639 --> 00:11:21.039	So, I can say the V z is model using g by dz where dz is equal to 1 plus k equal to 1 to n alpha k z to the power minus k. So, dz has an n if it is order is n, so n number of pole.
15.srt	00:11:22.809 --> 00:11:27.470	So, I can say V z is a all pole model which has n number of pole.
15.srt	00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:30.759	So, if I have a 10 junction tube 10 tube.
15.srt	00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:40.379	10 10 section tube then I can say 10 poles will be there 10 poles will be there.
15.srt	00:11:40.969 --> 00:11:43.579	So, now if dz is real.
15.srt	00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:49.490	So, the dz have either the all real pole will be the real function.
15.srt	00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:54.279	So, there will be real pole will be occur or there will all pole have a complex conjugate in nature.
15.srt	00:11:56.329 --> 00:12:01.329	So, if dz has a n number of pole then I can say there is a n by 2.
15.srt	00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:08.389	So, this 2 complex conjugate pole will be there, n by 2 pair of complex conjugate pole.
15.srt	00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:27.100	So, I can say v z is nothing but a g by k equal to 1 to n by 2 1 minus alpha k z to the power minus 1 into 1 minus alpha k star z to the power minus 1.
15.srt	00:12:32.259 --> 00:12:37.850	So, it is nothing but a n by 2 complex conjugate pole product.
15.srt	00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:44.129	So, what is if you see that then if I say this is my unit circle.
15.srt	00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.659	So, complex conjugate pole.
15.srt	00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.309	So, this is the real axis, this is the imaginary axis.
15.srt	00:12:51.649 --> 00:13:02.429	If a pole occur in here with a angle of theta, there will be another pole which is conjugate this pole minus theta.
15.srt	00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:10.750	So, if there is a pole in here, there will be another pole will be in here.
15.srt	00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.279	If the pole in here, there will be another pole will be here.
15.srt	00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.590	So, every pole has a complex conjugate pole.
15.srt	00:13:19.539 --> 00:13:27.149	If it is complex number, then alpha k I can say it is nothing but a r k e to the power j theta.
15.srt	00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.289	So, a complex number has a two pole, let this is the pole.
15.srt	00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:40.330	So, this has and this has a amplitude r. So, alpha k can be represented using r k and e to the power j theta.
15.srt	00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:43.000	This r k is not reflection coefficient.
15.srt	00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.899	So, there is a amplitude of the pole and e to the power j theta.
15.srt	00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:55.399	So, if I say alpha k complex conjugate part, it will be nothing but a r k amplitude will be same e to the power minus j theta.
15.srt	00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.300	Value of alpha complex conjugate pole.
15.srt	00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.560	Now, interpret the value of value of alpha.
15.srt	00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:24.970	So, if I do that, if I put the value of alpha in here, then the dz will become or you can say vz will become g by 1 minus alpha k z to the power minus 1 into 1 minus alpha k star z to the power minus 1.
15.srt	00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.690	Let us write down this product.
15.srt	00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.389	I have not and product of k equal to 1 to n by 2.
15.srt	00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.420	So, if I do this one, instead of alpha k, I put the value of r k e to the power z theta.
15.srt	00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:42.110	Instead of alpha star k, I can put the r k e to the power minus z theta.
15.srt	00:14:42.390 --> 00:15:00.250	If I put that value, it will come g by 1 minus 2 r k cos theta k z to the power minus 1 plus r k square z to the power minus 2 for this complex conjugate product.
15.srt	00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:13.310	So, I can now if you see the v z, v k z in term of this one, this is v k z, v z if I want v z, write v z.
15.srt	00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:32.840	then there will be a product of pi equal to k k equal to 1 to n. So, v k I can say this two only this is v if I write v k this one then I do not write this product term ok. Now, if it is that then what is contribution of r k and v k?
15.srt	00:15:44.929 --> 00:16:00.960	Let us r k is equal to e to the power minus v k and v k is equal to so, v k is equal to minus Now, importance of this V k is nothing but a produce a bandwidth, V k produce a bandwidth and theta k give the formant position.
15.srt	00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:11.809	When the value of R k approach to unit, I can get the formant frequency, resonance frequency.
15.srt	00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:16.549	So, if it is R k approach to unit, close to unit circle.
15.srt	00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.370	then I can get the resonant frequency.
15.srt	00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:25.610	And if the B k value is non-zero, then I get a bandwidth pole.
15.srt	00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.629	There will be a pole, there will be a formant which has a bandwidth.
15.srt	00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:40.790	So, B k provide me the bandwidth, theta k provide me the formant position.
15.srt	00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.720	So, this information will be used when we develop the model.
15.srt	00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:50.980	using linear prediction model for speech production system.
15.srt	00:16:52.120 --> 00:17:01.129	So, if I know the theta k, if I know the theta k and value of r k, then I can model the system.
15.srt	00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:17.400	Theta k give me the formant frequency position and if r k tends to 0, tends to unit circle, amplitude of that pole is tends to your close to unit circle that give you the.
15.srt	00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:22.720	formant frequency in the spectrogram.
15.srt	00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:36.420	So, if I give you the formant frequency and formant bandwidth, if I able to find out for a speech event, I can able to derive the transfer function for that speech event the vocal tract transfer function.
15.srt	00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:53.599	Now, if I say that that event is given, so speech event let us say speech event the steady state vowel r. If I take the steady state vowel and analyze the frequency analysis and find out the formant frequency and formant bandwidth.
15.srt	00:17:54.129 --> 00:18:01.129	then I can able to find out the transfer function of that Vogel trap.
15.srt	00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:08.480	So, complex conjugate now, so do not confuse with number of complex conjugate pole and pole, number of normal pole.
15.srt	00:18:08.889 --> 00:18:18.180	So, if there is a n-tube model, n-tube model is there, then I can get n by 2 complex conjugate pole.
15.srt	00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.869	So, there will be a n by 2 formant.
15.srt	00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:42.799	So, if I able to Let us there is a n equal to 10 tube, I take 10 tube to model this whole vocal tract system is divided by 10 part and model it, then I can get 10 by 2 complex conjugate pole.
15.srt	00:18:43.129 --> 00:18:50.489	So, I can get 5 formant frequency.
15.srt	00:18:55.689 --> 00:18:56.849	On the other hand, let us I derive that mathematics, there is a example I have given in the in the slides.
15.srt	00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:04.299	Let the length of the vocal track L is equal to 17 centimeter and the velocity of sound is 340 meter per second.
15.srt	00:19:04.659 --> 00:19:09.809	Find the number of section required to generate 5 kilohertz bandwidth voice signal.
15.srt	00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.740	So, I have to generate 5 kilohertz bandwidth voice signal.
15.srt	00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.439	What should be the sampling frequency?
15.srt	00:19:20.089 --> 00:19:24.929	F s should be 10 kilohertz or not?
15.srt	00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:27.069	F s should be 10 kilohertz.
15.srt	00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:29.549	Then what is my tau?
15.srt	00:19:29.779 --> 00:19:35.940	Tau is nothing but a x by c. So, what is x?
15.srt	00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:38.359	x is the length of each section.
15.srt	00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.970	I have to find out number of section required.
15.srt	00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.549	So, let us I require a n number of section.
15.srt	00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:24.659	So, if the length of the tube is l, then the x is equal to l by n. So, then tau is equal to L by N into C. Now, if it is L is equal to 17.5 centimeter and C is equal to 35 centimeter per second, then I can find out it is nothing but a 17.5 divided by N into 35 triple 0 which is nothing but a 175.
15.srt	00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:34.789	divided by n into 350 let us write 350 into 10 to the power 3.
15.srt	00:20:35.129 --> 00:20:36.069	So, it is 2.
15.srt	00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:43.029	So, it is nothing but a 1 by 2 n into 10 to the power 3.
15.srt	00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:47.159	Now, what is tau?
15.srt	00:20:48.389 --> 00:20:49.289	So, what is T?
15.srt	00:20:50.089 --> 00:20:56.970	T is equal to 1 by F s. So, that T is nothing but a T is equal to 2 tau.
15.srt	00:20:57.789 --> 00:21:08.509	So, tau is equal to T by 2, tau is equal to T by 2, what is T?
15.srt	00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:25.140	T is nothing but a 1 by f s. So, it is nothing but a 2 by f s. So, I can write 1 by 2 f s is equal to 1 by 2 n 10 to the power 3, 2 to cancel.
15.srt	00:21:27.879 --> 00:21:30.500	So, it is n is equal to by 10 to the power 3.
15.srt	00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:47.379	So, F s is equal to 10 kilohertz, which is 10 kilohertz, nothing but a 10 section.
15.srt	00:21:47.679 --> 00:22:01.709	Or I can say n is nothing but a F s by n by 2, I can say, 10 to the power n by 2 is nothing but a bandwidth, if it is F s is equal to 2 B.
15.srt	00:22:02.519 --> 00:22:04.730	5 kilohertz.
15.srt	00:22:04.899 --> 00:22:13.159	So, 10 section is required to model that tube 5 kilohertz bandwidth I require 10 section.
15.srt	00:22:14.339 --> 00:22:33.430	So, similar kind of mathematics you can expect that if I want to generate 4 kilohertz bandwidth signal and f s is equal to let us 8 kilohertz sampling frequency is equal to 8 kilohertz, then find out the number of section is required minimum number of section is required.
15.srt	00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:38.789	So, I can find out the number of section is required.
15.srt	00:22:40.069 --> 00:22:43.529	So, this way I can find out and this way I can model that signal.
15.srt	00:22:43.949 --> 00:22:52.289	So, since that vocal track can be modeled as a all pole model, I am not going details of that thing, this is the form and trajectory.
15.srt	00:22:52.889 --> 00:22:56.629	So, I can see that the whole V z can be.
15.srt	00:22:56.689 --> 00:23:01.250	So, this is the V k is the product of this, if it is right V z then product will be here.
15.srt	00:23:01.599 --> 00:23:04.899	So, I can say this digital implementation again same.
15.srt	00:23:07.299 --> 00:23:10.980	each of the chunk represent the formant frequency.
15.srt	00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:14.970	This is the first formant 1, formant 2, formant 3, so that will come.
15.srt	00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:27.319	So, each stage represent one formant frequency, each stage represent one formant frequency.
15.srt	00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:30.519	So, there will be n by 2 number of stage will be there.
15.srt	00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:36.259	So, if it is n by 2 number of stage, then n by 2 formant frequency will be.
15.srt	00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:37.080	there.
15.srt	00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:59.540	So, I can say that lossless tube model lossless vocal tube model can be done by a linear system which is nothing but a v z is a linear system v z is equal to 1 plus k is equal to 1 to n n alpha k z to the power minus k LTI.
15.srt	00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.800	So, we will discuss the about that LTI system.
15.srt	00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:06.860	So, this I can say in summary.
15.srt	00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:14.220	This is a vocal track V z radiation is R z and got all plus is G z.
15.srt	00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:29.320	So, if I say what is the total transfer function is nothing, but a H z whole speech production transfer function G z V z into R z.
15.srt	00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:37.950	Whole H z the if I say the from the speech I want to find out H z which is the product of.
15.srt	00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.920	and lip radiation and I get the speech signal.
15.srt	00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:50.900	So, random noise passes through vocal track and included lip radiation produce the speech for unvoiced speech.
15.srt	00:24:51.059 --> 00:25:00.470	If it is a voiced speech, impulse strain will be modified by the Guadal pulse generator and that will pass through the vocal track and lip radiation produce the speech.
15.srt	00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:09.599	So, if you see three Tufts pole function, G z can be approximate by the second order this two pole two pole function.
15.srt	00:25:10.049 --> 00:25:13.160	for radiation there will be a one single pole is required.
15.srt	00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.710	So, 2 plus 1 3 pole if I do that then I can get a z.
15.srt	00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:34.440	So, we will discuss about that how many pole of course, the order of the linear prediction analysis that things during the linear prediction analysis function what is the how do you get the order of the linear prediction that time we use this information.
15.srt	00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.970	So, this is the whole vocal tract tube modeling.
15.srt	00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.069	So, in summary I can say.
15.srt	00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:55.850	The vocal track, this human vocal track can be modeled using a digital signal processing or it or can be implemented using a digital linear filter based on that requirement.
15.srt	00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:14.380	So, we have shown that if I consider this vocal track is a fun or you can is a simulated using a number of junks or number of section lossless tube section less n number of lossless tube section that then it can be implemented.
15.srt	00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:23.790	using a linear time linear system which is v z and which can be implemented in digital domain.
15.srt	00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:27.990	So, that is why this is called uniform tube modeling.
15.srt	00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:38.610	The throughout the section if I say n number of section throughout the each section the cross sectional area of the vocal chord I said uniform.
15.srt	00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.830	So, I can say throughout the whole vocal track can be single tube whole vocal track can be two tube.
15.srt	00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:52.650	or whole vocal tag can be n number of tube, but if I say n number of tube each tube cross sectional area is constant.
15.srt	00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:59.960	That is why uniform and lossless also because if it is lossy then all kinds of complexity will come up.
15.srt	00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:10.440	So, if it is lossless uniform tube model then it can be implemented using digital system that is V z.
15.srt	00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:17.660	Once I know that then I know yes if it is implementable via V z.
15.srt	00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:27.070	Then, can I think that output speech which has collected using a microphone cannot, can it be analyzed using linear signal processing?
15.srt	00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.480	Yes.
15.srt	00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.080	So, that is from there the concept of linear prediction analysis comes.
15.srt	00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:35.060	So, this system can be linearly modeled.
15.srt	00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:44.560	So, from the signal if I want to find out the transfer function, that is why I want to predict the vocal tract constriction.
15.srt	00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:49.510	So, if I know the signal, yes it is possible to find out the signal.
15.srt	00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:59.870	area cross sectional area of different section if I say it is n tube model n different section cross sectional area is possible to find out from the behavior of output speech.
15.srt	00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:11.460	Or if I know the area function I can implement it digitally it is possible to implement it if I excited by impulse response I can able to produce the speech.
15.srt	00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.320	So, this is the tube modeling.
15.srt	00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.780	So, this is called uniform tube model lossless tube modeling of speech production.
15.srt	00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.400	system.
15.srt	00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.280	Thank you.
11.srt	00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:31.050	So, now we have derived that transfer function of lossless tube without considering any loss infinite power at 500 hertz 1.5 kilo hertz 2.5 kilo hertz.
11.srt	00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:53.109	Now, if I consider that the tube the wall which I suppose to be rigid, if this wall is not rigid, this wall can flexible, this wall can modify if pressure is high, if there is a pressure wall can change.
11.srt	00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.670	So, what is happening instead of cross sectional area A is fixed.
11.srt	00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:29.280	Now, A is also function of x and t, a is also function of x and t. So, any time the cross sectional area A x t is nothing but a average area or you can say the A x t plus delta change of A x t due to the pressure at that position and that time delta a.
11.srt	00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:33.900	So, if you see the slides, if you see the slides, I have the slides is there.
11.srt	00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.030	So, inside it is A 0 t, I can say it is A 0 t.
11.srt	00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.539	fixed and then it is delta A x t is expansion.
11.srt	00:01:44.959 --> 00:02:04.349	So, now if I instead of u A and rho A the wave equation I have modified because the wave equation instead of fixed A, A is modified then if I put this one A 0 x t into del A x t for A 0 x t then the modified equation will be like this.
11.srt	00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.799	So, I am not going details.
11.srt	00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.209	modified equation mathematical things then it will be take lot of time.
11.srt	00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.060	So, I this is not that objective to derive the details.
11.srt	00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.639	Details can be available in the papers also mathematical details.
11.srt	00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.829	So, there is a complex equation will come out if I see the complex.
11.srt	00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:31.169	So, I can say this tube is made of a muscles I can say muscle is nothing but a spring mass action.
11.srt	00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.870	So, it is nothing but a spring mass mechanical oscillator if I consider the second order equation of the spring mass mechanical oscillator.
11.srt	00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.620	then this will be like this.
11.srt	00:02:41.150 --> 00:03:02.420	Then again if I 1, 2, 3 if I consider and then the wave equation instead of 2 wave wave equation with this 3 equation will derive and from that 3 equation I get an analytical solution of what will happen in the frequency response which is V a omega U l omega divided by U g omega.
11.srt	00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:11.449	Now they said if the length of the tube is 17.5 centimeter and 5 centimeter square is the cross sectional area.
11.srt	00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.469	and m omega is 0.5 gram per centimeter square b omega is 659 that means m omega is nothing but a mass per unit length b omega damping per unit length and stiffness per unit length of the vocal tract wall ok if i consider that value then it is said it was found in the frequency response earlier it was infinite energy 500 hertz 1.5 kilo hertz 2.5 kilohertz like that it is said that complex pole with non zero bandwidth.
11.srt	00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:59.689	So, here it is zero bandwidth here it is zero bandwidth bandwidth is zero in loss less condition.
11.srt	00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:09.080	Now if I introduce the loss what will happen then instead of zero bandwidth some bandwidth will be generated.
11.srt	00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.770	So, the poles are complex with non zero bandwidth.
11.srt	00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:32.960	slightly higher frequency the frequency will be instead of 500 hertz it may be 500 and 5 hertz slightly frequency shifted towards the higher frequency side most effected in the lower band lower frequency will be the most.
11.srt	00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.950	So, lower frequency bandwidth will be increased more compared to the higher frequency.
11.srt	00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.410	So, most effected is the lower band.
11.srt	00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.310	Now, if I consider losses and not rigid wall.
11.srt	00:04:48.920 --> 00:05:02.759	So, instead of a infinite band 0 bandwidth infinite impulse at every resonant frequency, it becomes a finite bandwidth with a slightly shifting higher direction of the formant.
11.srt	00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.090	So, formant is shifted slightly higher direction.
11.srt	00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:14.970	So, instead of this figure ultimately I will get some bandwidth kind of formant, but if you want to see more or less.
11.srt	00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.959	it will be on and around of 500 hertz slightly shifted.
11.srt	00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:39.480	So, I can easily say normally if it is tube is totally open first ferment is 500 hertz, second ferment is 1.5 kilohertz, third ferment is 2.5 kilohertz, third ferment is 2.5 kilohertz, fourth ferment is 3.5 kilohertz, fifth ferment is 4.5 kilohertz.
11.srt	00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.800	So, now if we see if a signal is band limited with 4 kilohertz.
11.srt	00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:56.910	then I can say I only can get up to fourth format, I cannot get the fifth format because fifth format is 4.5 kilohertz.
11.srt	00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.189	So, I will not get it.
11.srt	00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.480	So, if I cut the signal in here, I will get only three format, if I cut the signal in there, I can get the three or four format.
11.srt	00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.620	So, depends on the sampling frequency format will come, I will come this will discuss later on also.
11.srt	00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.110	So, I am not detailed discuss about the this kind of losses.
11.srt	00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.230	Now, second effect of radiation at leaf.
11.srt	00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.660	So, what I said once the air is radiated from the mouth.
11.srt	00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:34.410	So, I can say at the opening of the tube the acoustic wave is radiated.
11.srt	00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.560	So, the radiation this radiation why it is radiated in the atmospheric air.
11.srt	00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.500	So, what will be the radiation losses?
11.srt	00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.760	What kind of effect I will get due to this?
11.srt	00:06:49.030 --> 00:07:10.700	So, now if you see the assume that P L T is equal to 0 at lift this is the we have assume the acoustical analog a short circuit the output where you couple this thing if I say transmission line I said the output is totally short circuit T is equal to 0 T means the voltage is equal to 0.
11.srt	00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:16.420	So, output is short circuit here I said there is a no load no acoustic load.
11.srt	00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.750	So, it is loaded 0 output is short circuit it is ideal condition.
11.srt	00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:21.720	but it may not be the ideal condition.
11.srt	00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:30.920	So, what will be the effect of air load on the lip or you can say the radiation effect on the acoustic wave transmission.
11.srt	00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:36.600	So, then if I put the microphone then I can say what kind of signal I am expecting from the mouth.
11.srt	00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:41.560	Now, if I consider that how do you do that?
11.srt	00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.480	So, I can say let us this is the tube and this is the mouth here it is radiated.
11.srt	00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.079	So, whole load is the atmospheric load is there in the in the leaf.
11.srt	00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:21.060	So, let us the load is nothing but a inductive and resistive load L R and R R, acoustics mass inductive load and resistive load ok. Now, it is there then I can say here it is P L omega.
11.srt	00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:35.879	is nothing but a P l omega is nothing but a less this constitute this load constitute a Z r. So, Z r into u l omega.
11.srt	00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:52.600	So, I have not writing small u it is keep it capital U l omega means length omega means instead of time it is frequency it is length and frequency capital P frequency response P l omega is nothing but a Z r into u l omega or I can say.
11.srt	00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:08.690	that p l omega p l t is nothing but a small p l t is nothing but a Z r into u l t. Now, what is Z r?
11.srt	00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.820	Z r is nothing but a these two are in parallel.
11.srt	00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:22.930	So, j omega you can say that j omega l r r divided by j omega omega l r.
11.srt	00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:34.600	the acoustics load in the radiation load in here is not there it is totally short circuit which is the ideal condition we said p l t is equal to 0.
11.srt	00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.770	So, the frequency response whatever we have get due to the considering the loss and that things that will be remain constant remain same that means that implies or that means that at low frequency components are not affected by the radiation load because at low frequency radiation load does not affect the frequency response of the acoustical tube.
11.srt	00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.580	So, low frequency are less affected.
11.srt	00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:26.670	Now, if I say J omega or omega L r is much greater than R r at high frequency much much greater than R r then I can say it is nothing it is nothing but a R r J omega L J omega L cancel.
11.srt	00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:32.430	So, it is nothing but a R R. So, load is totally resistive.
11.srt	00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:39.360	So, radiation load is resistive means there is a loss radiation loss.
11.srt	00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:45.890	So, I can say high frequency are effected due to the radiation loss.
11.srt	00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:56.110	So, I can say the frequency response which I will get after the R R is high.
11.srt	00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:12.520	Considering the losses with the bandwidth, If it is passed through the radiation loss then low frequency will not affected much more, but high frequency will be lost.
11.srt	00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:23.660	So, I will explain it in here if you see this is the figure with the no loss condition at 500 hertz infinite energy 0 bandwidth.
11.srt	00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:32.300	If I consider the wall vibration then I say the bandwidth is increases slightly amplitude increases in high frequency.
11.srt	00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:38.750	and bandwidth is introduced and bandwidth in the low frequency are much more.
11.srt	00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:50.600	Then if I say the Vesca's law, friction laws consider then again the bandwidth is increased the bandwidth and slightly decrease the formant frequency, it slightly increase the formant frequency.
11.srt	00:11:50.600 --> 00:12:00.210	So, increase decrease if I cancel out I can say the formant frequency is around whatever 500 as I have get here, but bandwidth is here, here is 0 bandwidth.
11.srt	00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.710	Now if I consider the radiation laws.
11.srt	00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:10.890	Then if you see high frequency or resistive radiation, so this circuit this will be suppressed.
11.srt	00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:19.500	So radiation loss due to the radiation loss high frequency components amplitude will be decreased.
11.srt	00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:32.820	Now if you see that also here also then in mathematics H j omega transfer function of the tube is nothing but a P l omega divided by U g omega which is P l omega U l omega.
11.srt	00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.600	So it is nothing but a Z r omega.
11.srt	00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:55.940	will be multiplied with the V omega Z r omega is 1 or no effect if omega is very low if Z r omega is sorry if the omega is low radiation effect is not negligible if it is Z r omega is omega is very high then there is a lot of attenuation in the high frequency.
11.srt	00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:05.160	So, frequency response of the Z r omega is nothing but like this this taper high if the frequency increases loss is increases.
11.srt	00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:21.360	So, that is why if I see any speech signal, if you see the speech signal, it will look like that high frequency or amplitude or less, this is due to the radiation loss, high frequency amplitude or very less.
11.srt	00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:35.810	So, this is the frequency response of the uniform tube, if I consider whole tube vocal track is a single tube, then I say this is the frequency response, this is the transfer function of the single tube model.
11.srt	00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:54.460	the frequency response is that for when frequency are 500 hertz 1.5 kilo hertz 2.5 kilo hertz, but the response is high frequency are attenuated due to the radiation loss and it is not 0 bandwidth because of the if I consider the losses inside the tube.
11.srt	00:13:54.460 --> 00:14:05.820	Now so vocal track can be characterized by a set of resonance that depends on the vocal track area function with shift due to the loss.
11.srt	00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.270	and radiation.
11.srt	00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:22.470	The bandwidth of the two lowest resonance depend primarily on the vocal track wall losses f 1 and f 2 and the bandwidth of the highest resonance depend the highest frequency resonance depend primarily on the viscous friction loss, thermal loss and radiation loss.
11.srt	00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:31.820	Because if you see I said the bandwidth is most affected frequency or low frequency in case of wall variation in the wall.
11.srt	00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:36.790	In case of viscous low high frequency bandwidth are introduced.
11.srt	00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.160	Now, next one is nozzle coupling effect.
11.srt	00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.960	This is one cavity I have done.
11.srt	00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:50.280	Now, if you see you experience that this is a cavity and you produce a sound.
11.srt	00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.150	Now, if I put a hole in here sound will change.
11.srt	00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:03.480	If you see the flute there is a lot of hole in the top of the flute and by pressing the closing the hole I can change the sound.
11.srt	00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.180	If you see that flute or saxophone playing just closing the valve means I am closing the hole in the tube.
11.srt	00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:16.520	So, if I put a hole here you know the frequency response is changed the tube frequency response will be changed.
11.srt	00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:24.480	Now in case of our case in vocal track also there is a nozzle coupling in here.
11.srt	00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:36.250	So, once the valium is open so nozzle coupling is coupled with the oral track, tube structure is changed the frequency response will be changed.
11.srt	00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:46.800	So, sound pressure the same as at the input of each tube the volume velocity is the sum of the volume velocity at the input to nozzle and oral cavity.
11.srt	00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:54.980	So, close oral cavity can trap energy at certain frequency preventing those frequency from appearing in the nozzle output.
11.srt	00:15:55.150 --> 00:16:06.540	So, if you think about why I am producing a nozzle consonant or nozzle sound if my oral cavity is totally closed then the air is coming through the nozzle.
11.srt	00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.790	Now, if the oral cavity is not totally closed then the nozzle and oral both cavity are.
11.srt	00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:18.050	So, if I consider the nozzle sound is coming in this path then some pressure will be trapped by this oral cavity.
11.srt	00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.180	So, that trap will produce some NT resonance frequency.
11.srt	00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:32.500	So, nozzle resonance have border bandwidth loss is much more much more.
11.srt	00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:41.480	So, bandwidth so, in case the formant bandwidth will be border in case of nozzle sound and the NT resonance will be there.
11.srt	00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:49.560	So, I can say dip if I say this this point will be much more larger point.
11.srt	00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.150	will be introduced.
11.srt	00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.400	So, bandwidth will be larger also.
11.srt	00:16:53.810 --> 00:17:01.010	So, compared to the oral sound, nasal sound bandwidth is larger.
11.srt	00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:20.340	Now, let us I stop here because next class I will start about the sound excite another topic which is called how the excitation will excite the vocal tract, then we will derive the two boundary condition which is as the lip and the glottis.
11.srt	00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:29.920	After derive considering the boundary condition, we will derive the total task function in digital domain and then try to implement is uniform tube model.
11.srt	00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.170	Then you go for the multi tube modeling of the human vocal track.
11.srt	00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:34.970	Thank you.
10.srt	00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:20.679	So, we have derived that 2 O M equation, this 2 O M equation we have derived.
10.srt	00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:28.280	Now, here one things is there that V is the particle velocity ok.
10.srt	00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:48.149	Now, if I say volume velocity, so if you see volume velocity, if the velocity is v of let us tube with the cross sectional area is a, then what is the volume velocity a into v the total volume v is the length of the tube and a is the cross sectional area.
10.srt	00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.109	So, v is the a into v is the volume.
10.srt	00:00:50.509 --> 00:01:00.670	So, if I say volume velocity is u, then u is equal to v by a or sorry u is equal to v into a.
10.srt	00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.659	or I can say v is equal to u by a.
10.srt	00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:22.390	Now, if I put this thing on put this thing on this two equations where I can say that del square or del p by del x is equal to minus rho del v by del t. So, this will become v is equal to u by a.
10.srt	00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:37.079	So, del del p by del x is equal to minus rho v u by a rho by a del u by del t. Similarly, del p by del t is equal to minus rho c square del v by del x this will become del p by del t is equal to minus rho c square rho c square minus rho c square or I can say u sorry this is del u by del t not del p del u by del t is or rho c square by a del v by del x or I can say del u by del x is equal to minus a by rho c square del p by del t ok. Now, if you see this equation and this equation, this two equation if you see.
10.srt	00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:54.870	is equal to C into del V by del t ok. Now, this is analogous to so, this two equation analogous to this is the electrical transmission line equation lossless electrical transmission line equation.
10.srt	00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.509	Then I can say if this this equation is analogous to this equation then I can say that P is analogous to V. So, pressure in acoustic domain domain is analogous to voltage in electrical domain.
10.srt	00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:22.089	Similarly, u is analogous to i, volume velocity in acoustic domain is equivalent to electrical current in electrical domain.
10.srt	00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:35.539	And if I say l is equal to rho by a, so this rho by a is called acoustical inductance, acoustical inductance.
10.srt	00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.030	Similarly, I can say that a by rho c square is analogous to C. So, it is called acoustical capacitance.
10.srt	00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:54.590	a by rho c square is acoustical capacitance and rho by a is the acoustical inductance.
10.srt	00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.120	p is analogous to voltage, current is analogous to volume velocity ok.
10.srt	00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:09.650	So, if you see this slide I have written this slide same things I have written in this slide ok. Now, so this I know.
10.srt	00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:16.610	So, I can say that if I know the equation I can analogous electric transmission line I can also draw.
10.srt	00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:21.860	This is same as electrical transmission line lossless transmission line.
10.srt	00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:35.550	Now, so what I want to know what I want to do is that I want to find out the transfer function of a uniform tube which is I can say this side is the vocal cords which acts as a piston.
10.srt	00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:47.129	So, x is equal to 0 where the force is applied in the tube and x is equal to L where the tube radiate the sound energy.
10.srt	00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.920	in the air.
10.srt	00:04:50.100 --> 00:05:06.870	Now, if I see that that this one this tube whole tube is nothing, but a this kind of situation pressure or you can say the pressure is applied in here acoustical pressure is applied in here.
10.srt	00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:18.350	So, I can say the particle velocity in this point I can say or volume velocity in this point is u 0 t and volume velocity at this point is u.
10.srt	00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:42.680	at this point is nothing but a P 0 t pressure at here is P x t and cross section of the tube is A the area cross sectional area of the tube is A ok. We consider throughout the tube A remain constant ok.
10.srt	00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.220	So, now A remain constant.
10.srt	00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.860	Now, try to find out the travelling wave solution.
10.srt	00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.270	in the tube ok. What are the travelling wave solution?
10.srt	00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:12.710	Now, if I say that minus del u by del x is equal to a by rho c square del p by del t or I can write down these two equation where I said this is the pressure wave equation not this not this one where it is this will be here.
10.srt	00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.320	So, this is the pressure wave equation this is the pressure wave equation and this is the velocity wave equation.
10.srt	00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:29.290	Now, I have to find out the solution of this second order differential equation and again solution of this second order differential equation give me the velocity.
10.srt	00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:36.610	So, if I draw the solution of this second order differential equation you know that second order differential is total solution is nothing but a.
10.srt	00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:49.500	So, I can say that u x t is equal to u plus t minus x y c minus u plus t plus x y c.
10.srt	00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.280	What is that?
10.srt	00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:00.350	T minus x by c, so I can say this is called forward wave, this is called backward wave.
10.srt	00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.820	So, in the tube there is a forward wave and there is a backward wave.
10.srt	00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:20.200	In the forward wave I can say the if the time axis this is the time axis is the forward wave then T is minus x by c. If it is the backward wave, so negative direction T plus x by c.
10.srt	00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.620	C is the velocity of the sound, x is the position.
10.srt	00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.939	Now, similarly what is P x t?
10.srt	00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:54.080	P x t is nothing but a rho c by a u plus t minus x by c plus u minus t plus x by c. So, this I can say is nothing but a Z, Z t which is called impedance of the transmission line or impedance of the acoustic tube is nothing but a.
10.srt	00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:08.009	u plus t minus x by c plus u minus t plus x by c ok.
10.srt	00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:11.129	So, where Z d is equal to rho c by a.
10.srt	00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:28.230	So, u plus is the forward wave u minus is the backward travelling wave ok. Now, if it is that then there is a two boundary condition in the tube if you see.
10.srt	00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:30.250	what is the boundary condition?
10.srt	00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:53.940	At the glottis at the here the glottis point where the vocal cords are vibrating here u 0 t is nothing, but a Guadal excitation which is nothing, but a less Guadal excitation is u g omega and equal to e into e to the power j omega t where this omega is the continuous frequency.
10.srt	00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.000	So, all frequency frequency of u.
10.srt	00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:27.900	So, I can say I excited the tube with unit impulse or I guess every frequency and I want to find out the every frequency response at the output ok. That is why I said omega E j omega t and this excitation is if it is impulse then that or you can say the excitation content all the frequency is equal amplitude and that amplitude is modify as per the gotel response gotel frequency response that is this u g omega ok.
10.srt	00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:45.850	So, I can say the the Gortle frequency response which is U G omega has to be passed through the tube and the tube output of the tube I have to find out and then output by input is the tube transfer function.
10.srt	00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.250	So, U 0 t U 0 t is nothing, but a U G omega e to the power j omega t. And at the leaf let us there is a radiation load is for the low frequency radiation load completely not there.
10.srt	00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.890	So, what will happen at the lifts it again it atmospheric pressure.
10.srt	00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:15.110	So, I can say P x P l t at x equal to l is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:28.210	So, if I put P l t so, what is u 0 t. So, u 0 t is u g omega e to the power j omega t is equal to u plus.
10.srt	00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.980	So, x is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:44.990	So, I can say u plus t minus u minus sorry this will be minus u minus t x equal to 0.
10.srt	00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.790	So, x equal to 0 will be not there.
10.srt	00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:54.340	So, I can say u plus t u minus t and if it is p l t then p l t is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:57.710	So, 0 is p l t is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:18.230	So, I can say z t into u plus t minus l by c plus u minus t plus l by c. So, there is a differential equation.
10.srt	00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:29.030	So, since the differential equation are linear with constant coefficient, the solution must be in the form of k plus k minus represent the amplitude and the forward and backward wave.
10.srt	00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.550	So, I can say if it is linear wave equation, forward wave u plus t or you can say the u plus t minus x by c can be represented in the form of amplitude let us this is k plus e to the power j omega t minus x by c differential equation second order differential equation and u minus I can say t plus x by c is nothing but a k minus e to the power j omega t plus by c exponential solution.
10.srt	00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.980	So, this is the exponential solution.
10.srt	00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:16.970	Now, if I put that value in two equation, equation number 1 in here and equation number 2 in here.
10.srt	00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:33.100	So, in 1 I can say u g omega e to the power j omega t is nothing but a k plus e to the power j omega t because x is equal to 0 minus.
10.srt	00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.620	k minus e to the power j omega t x equal to 0.
10.srt	00:12:39.400 --> 00:13:04.960	And similarly, 0 is equal to Z d into u plus k plus e to the power j omega t minus l by c plus k minus e to the power j omega t plus l by c. From here, I can say e to the power j omega t into j omega t.
10.srt	00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:19.139	So, I can say k plus minus k minus is equal to u g omega and here I can say z d is equal to k e to this is equal to this.
10.srt	00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:27.129	So, I can this is the equation number 1 and this is equation number 2 again I can solve for k plus and k minus.
10.srt	00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.779	I am not deducing the solution because you can do it easily.
10.srt	00:13:32.029 --> 00:13:36.570	So, you can just deduce the solution and find out the k plus and k minus.
10.srt	00:13:36.820 --> 00:14:07.269	So, K plus and K minus will be in the form of K plus will be equal to U G omega e to the power 2 J omega L by C divided by 1 plus e to the power 2 J omega L by C. This is the K plus and K minus will be minus U G omega.
10.srt	00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:45.759	divided by 1 plus e to the power 2 j omega L by c. Once I know the k plus and k minus, then I can write down the u x t, u x t is nothing but a k plus e to the power j omega t minus x by c minus e to the k minus e to the power j omega t plus x by c. Now, I put the value of k k plus is nothing but a u g omega this value in here and u k minus I can put the value in here.
10.srt	00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:31.370	Then if I put the value then I can say u g u g omega e to the power 2 j omega l by c divided by 1 plus e to the power 2 j omega l by c into e to the power j omega t minus x by c minus So, it is minus minus say plus u g omega u g omega divided by 1 plus e to the power 2 j omega L by c into e to the power j omega t plus x by c ok. Now, I can say that u g omega is common.
10.srt	00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:41.510	So, u g omega e to the power j omega t will be same ok e to the power j omega t.
10.srt	00:15:42.330 --> 00:16:12.120	Then, I can say it is nothing but a e to the power j omega 2 L 2 L minus x divided by c minus plus e to the sorry my plus e to the power j omega x by c divided by 1 plus e to the power 2 j omega.
10.srt	00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:21.760	by c. Now, if it is that then I can solve for that the this is the u g u g omega.
10.srt	00:16:43.090 --> 00:17:11.840	So, u g omega if I simplify it then u g omega sorry this is the u x t. So, ultimately if I again simplify it u x t will be in the form of cos omega l minus x by c divided by cos omega l by c cos omega l by c into u g omega e to the power j omega t. Here if I say that e to the power j theta that way if I do it l minus l minus x if I do that then it will cos omega l minus x by c into cos omega l by c by simplify it.
10.srt	00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:36.040	Similarly, if I will get the P x t, P x t will be j omega z d sin omega L minus x divided by c divided by cos omega L y c into u g omega e to the power j omega t, where z d is equal to rho c by a.
10.srt	00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:44.660	Now, I get this 2 u and P.
10.srt	00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:58.049	Now, what is if you see P is analogous to voltage, U is analogous to current.
10.srt	00:17:58.339 --> 00:18:20.569	Now, if I say what is the you can say the impedance Z is nothing but a P X T divided by U X T. If I do that P X T divided by U X T, so it will come J Z T into tan omega L minus X.
10.srt	00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:36.179	tan omega L minus x y c. This divided by this, so this divided by this, so cos by sin by cos tan this will come.
10.srt	00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:45.699	So, this is nothing but a acoustics impedance inside the tube at any point of x.
10.srt	00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.049	So, if x is equal to something I can find out the acoustic impedance.
10.srt	00:18:50.049 --> 00:18:52.769	So, now if the del x.
10.srt	00:18:53.049 --> 00:19:06.869	if the x is variation of x is very small then I can say that z is equal to nothing but a z z is nothing but a j omega rho by c rho by a into del x omega.
10.srt	00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:23.049	So, simplification of that for a small x del x is very small then I can do that ok. Now, so this is a z now if I interpreted this thing the part this is particle velocity the volume velocity this is pressure wave.
10.srt	00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:26.990	this is volume velocity and this is pressure wave.
10.srt	00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.350	Now, if I interpreted that things what is the envelope?
10.srt	00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:52.110	Here envelope is Z d pressure wave Z d sin omega L minus x by c this is part is the envelope part this part will be same variation e to the power j omega t that is actually like a envelope part and this is the envelope part in here.
10.srt	00:19:53.509 --> 00:19:58.000	Now, if you see this portion is constant if the L is constant this portion is constant.
10.srt	00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.720	So, one is sin omega another is cos.
10.srt	00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:18.040	So, if I say how the pressure amplitude pressure wave amplitude and volume velocity amplitude is vary inside the tube then I can say only x axis here x only I am I drawing the envelope portion.
10.srt	00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.850	So, one is sin another is cos.
10.srt	00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.710	So, if this is cos is the volume velocity.
10.srt	00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.140	So, if the particle velocity is maximum then pressure wave is minimum 0.
10.srt	00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.070	So, particle velocity will vary like this.
10.srt	00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:53.970	Then, pressure wave or volume velocity sorry u is the volume velocity pressure wave will be look like this one is cos another is sin.
10.srt	00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:02.090	Now, if I say real part of this part this real part of this.
10.srt	00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.370	So, I can say if I write.
10.srt	00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:34.800	u x t is equal to cos of omega L minus x y by c divided by cos omega L by c into u g omega e to the power j omega t. So, e to the power j omega t is nothing but a cos omega t plus j.
10.srt	00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:45.050	sin omega t. So, cos part is the real part, sin part is the imaginary part.
10.srt	00:21:45.240 --> 00:22:06.870	So, I can say the real part of u x t is nothing but a cos omega L minus x divided by c divided by cos omega L by c into u g omega.
10.srt	00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:16.160	cos omega t. Similarly, I can get the real part of the pressure wave ok or not.
10.srt	00:22:16.619 --> 00:22:31.039	So, real part of this u u g omega t is this one only ok. Now, I come to the transfer function of the tube.
10.srt	00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:40.769	So, in the tube I can say this is x equal to 0, this is x equal to L. So, if I say input is u 0 t.
10.srt	00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.480	and output is u x t volume velocity.
10.srt	00:22:44.639 --> 00:23:03.700	So, I can say the V a transfer function V a omega is nothing, but a u x sorry u l t u l t divided by u 0 t x is l and x is 0 here ok.
10.srt	00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:04.599	So, what is that?
10.srt	00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:11.649	Now, if I see that u is equal to cos omega l minus x by c. So, at u at l.
10.srt	00:23:12.069 --> 00:23:39.799	x is equal to L cos omega L minus at x equal to L x equal to L divided by c divided by cos omega L by c into u g omega e to the power j omega t which is nothing but a u L t. So, u L t it is L minus L is 0.
10.srt	00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:56.500	So, it is nothing but a 1 by cos omega l by c u g omega e to the power j omega t. Now, what is u 0 t?
10.srt	00:23:57.349 --> 00:24:07.180	u 0 t is nothing, but a u g omega e to the power j omega t which is got all impulse at the got is point here.
10.srt	00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:14.119	So, if I say u l t by u ah ah u 0 t.
10.srt	00:24:45.559 --> 00:25:06.619	So, VA omega is nothing but a ULT 1 by cos omega L by C into UG omega e to the power j omega t divided by UG omega e to the power j omega t. This will cancel, so it is nothing but a 1 by cos omega L by C. So, transfer function of the uniform tube where this side is closed and mouth is open x equal to 0 and x equal to l is 1 by cos omega l by c. Now, if it is 1 by cos omega l by c then what is the pole position?
10.srt	00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:08.829	What do you mean by pole position?
10.srt	00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:10.019	Pole you know that pole.
10.srt	00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:16.169	So, any transfer function let us say h omega is nothing but a consists from some p omega divided by q omega.
10.srt	00:25:17.059 --> 00:25:24.609	So, there is some pole and some solution of P will give me the 0 solution of Q will give me the pole.
10.srt	00:25:26.519 --> 00:25:34.129	So, if you see solution of Q when Q omega Q omega is equal to 0 then what is the amplitude value?
10.srt	00:25:34.639 --> 00:25:42.289	Value is infinite that means, at the pole the resonance of the system is occur.
10.srt	00:25:48.249 --> 00:25:49.279	So, I get the highest energy maximum energy resonance will be occur at pole every pole.
10.srt	00:25:50.119 --> 00:25:53.729	So, if I have a 5 pole I get 5 resonance frequency.
10.srt	00:25:53.729 --> 00:26:01.349	So, if the fifth order Q is the order is the fifth that means, I can get the fifth solution 5 solution 5 solution give me the 5 resonance frequency.
10.srt	00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:19.349	How many solution I can get here cos theta is equal to 0 when when omega L by C is equal to 2 n plus 1 into pi by 2 cos pi by 2.
10.srt	00:26:20.509 --> 00:26:32.169	2 cos pi by 2 0 again it will be 0 and where pi ok.
10.srt	00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:36.129	So, cos pi by 2 is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:26:36.129 --> 00:26:46.429	So, it cos pi by 2 is equal to 0 again it will be 0 when it is 3 pi by 2 when it is 5 pi by 2 that way if it is happen then it will be 0 ok.
10.srt	00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:52.159	So, 1 by the VA is nothing, but a 1 by cos pi by 2. .
10.srt	00:26:52.449 --> 00:26:57.119	omega L by C ok.
10.srt	00:26:57.399 --> 00:27:13.689	So, what I describe that any transfer function can be written any any system transfer function h omega can be written as p omega divided by q omega p omega divided by q omega.
10.srt	00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:24.149	Now, if you know that solution of p omega this polynomial will give me the what 0 and solution of this.
10.srt	00:27:24.689 --> 00:27:29.269	omega will give me the pole that is why p h omega is called the pole 0 function.
10.srt	00:27:30.439 --> 00:27:40.029	So, 0 and pole now what is the physical significance of pole suppose I said there is a pole what do you mean by pole physically what will happen.
10.srt	00:27:40.569 --> 00:27:57.659	Now, if you see what do you mean by solution of q omega at solution point q omega will be 0 if I put it 0 then h omega value will be infinite at solution point of p omega.
10.srt	00:27:57.979 --> 00:28:03.619	p omega will be 0, the solution point of p omega then h omega will be 0.
10.srt	00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:17.789	So, I can see that if each solution point of q omega that means, in every pole the system response will be infinite.
10.srt	00:28:19.079 --> 00:28:27.569	So, that means, system will resonate and every solution for p omega which is nothing but a 0.
10.srt	00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:33.109	the system response will be 0 that is why it is called pole 0.
10.srt	00:28:33.469 --> 00:28:41.599	So, every pole corresponding to a resonance in speech those resonance are called formant ok.
10.srt	00:28:41.869 --> 00:28:44.989	In speech those resonance are called formant.
10.srt	00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:56.319	So, I know if I want to know the formant response or frequency response of V omega V a omega then I have to find out where its resonance is occur.
10.srt	00:28:58.029 --> 00:29:02.509	When the resonance isck when cos omega L by c is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:29:05.609 --> 00:29:15.549	So, if I want to know at which frequency this cos omega L by c is equal to 0 at which frequency.
10.srt	00:29:15.829 --> 00:29:28.739	So, what is omega is continuous frequency is nothing but a 2 pi f. So, I put so omega is equal to 2 pi f when cos theta will be 0.
10.srt	00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:37.199	cos theta will be 0 if theta is equal to pi by 2 theta is equal to pi by 2 cos theta is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:45.439	So, I know cos so omega L by c should be pi by 2.
10.srt	00:29:45.949 --> 00:29:53.939	Now, when pi by 2 let us I put that 2 pi f L by c is equal to pi by 2.
10.srt	00:29:59.459 --> 00:30:00.729	So, I know at theta is equal to pi by 2 theta is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:07.999	So, omega L by C is equal to pi by 2 if pi if pi by 2 then cos omega L by C is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:30:08.189 --> 00:30:11.719	So, resonance will be occur.
10.srt	00:30:11.719 --> 00:30:25.639	So, first resonance because cos theta can be 0 not only pi by 2, but cos theta is equal to 0 if theta is equal to pi by 2 not only pi by 2 if theta is equal to 3 pi by 2 then also it is 0.
10.srt	00:30:27.149 --> 00:30:30.369	If it is 5 pi by 2 then also it is 0.
10.srt	00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:38.399	minimum frequency first that is why you call first resonance frequency is theta is equal to pi by 2.
10.srt	00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:52.279	So, pi pi cancel it is nothing but a 2 into f L by c is equal to half or I can say f is equal to c by 4 L. Now, what is c?
10.srt	00:30:52.589 --> 00:30:54.309	c is the velocity of sound.
10.srt	00:30:54.639 --> 00:30:55.249	What is L?
10.srt	00:31:03.129 --> 00:31:04.879	L is the length of the tube average human vocal cord length is equal to L is equal to 17.5 centimeter.
10.srt	00:31:04.879 --> 00:31:06.609	So, L is equal to 17.5 centimeter.
10.srt	00:31:06.609 --> 00:31:08.089	What is C?
10.srt	00:31:08.339 --> 00:31:15.089	Velocity of sound, velocity of sound is 35 centimeter per second.
10.srt	00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:26.329	So, I can say F is equal to 35000 divided by 4 into 17.5 which is equal to 500 Hertz.
10.srt	00:31:33.429 --> 00:31:41.909	If omega L by C is equal to 3 pi by 2, then F will becomes 1.5 kilohertz.
10.srt	00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:45.909	So, it is F 1 first formant, second formant.
10.srt	00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:53.909	If it is third formant, then omega L by C is equal to 5 pi by 2, then it will become 2.5 kilohertz.
10.srt	00:31:53.909 --> 00:32:02.329	If you see distance between the first formant and second formant is 1 kilohertz.
10.srt	00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:08.789	second formant and third formant is 1 kilohertz it is fixed because tube length is fixed.
10.srt	00:32:10.879 --> 00:32:21.239	This is similar with your earlier physics theory that if this side is closed then the first harmonics will occur at lambda by 4.
10.srt	00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:24.269	So, L is equal to lambda by 4.
10.srt	00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:33.809	So, F is equal to C by lambda which becomes C by 4 L. C is the velocity and L is the length of the tube which is thin.
10.srt	00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:35.809	in here also.
10.srt	00:32:35.809 --> 00:32:43.549	Then it will be odd multiples of, so it is not f is equal to nothing but a 2 n plus 1 c by 4 lambda.
10.srt	00:32:46.299 --> 00:32:50.299	So, here also same, so f 1, f 2, f 3 I can get.
10.srt	00:32:50.539 --> 00:32:56.609	Now, can I draw the frequency response of the uniform tube, where there is no loss, no nothing, nothing loss.
10.srt	00:32:57.009 --> 00:33:05.639	So, I can say if this is my frequency axis, this is 500 hertz, this is 1.5 kilo hertz.
10.srt	00:33:07.339 --> 00:33:08.919	this is 2.5 kilohertz.
10.srt	00:33:08.919 --> 00:33:15.179	So, at 500 hertz power is maxima.
10.srt	00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:23.509	So, on it will going.
10.srt	00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:25.579	So, it is I can put a arrow in here.
10.srt	00:33:25.579 --> 00:33:27.219	So, it is infinite power.
10.srt	00:33:27.219 --> 00:33:35.649	So, it is a impulse with a impulse power at 500 hertz.
10.srt	00:33:36.569 --> 00:33:40.099	0 and bandwidth is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:46.809	This is real pole, so bandwidth is equal to 0.
10.srt	00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:57.519	Bandwidth is equal to 0 with 0 bandwidth infinite power resonance will occur at 500 hertz, 1.5 kilohertz, 2.5 kilohertz.
10.srt	00:33:57.519 --> 00:34:03.819	If the length of the vocal tube is 17.5 centimeter and velocity of the sound is 35000 centimeter per.
10.srt	00:34:06.689 --> 00:34:07.039	second.
10.srt	00:34:09.059 --> 00:34:27.719	So, that I know this is the frequency response for the uniform tube model with without considering any kinds of loss or any the walls is rigid wall not variable wall means walls is rigid.
10.srt	00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:36.299	So, next lecture I will discuss how this response will be effected if I consider one loss.
10.srt	00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:37.279	at a time.
10.srt	00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:39.979	If I consider one loss, how it will be modified?
10.srt	00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:41.809	Second loss, how it will be modified?
10.srt	00:34:42.209 --> 00:34:54.679	Then ultimately we can get what should be the frequency response or what should be the response of this vocal tract tube if I get it and what should be the transfer function.
10.srt	00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:55.389	Thank you.
12.srt	00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:27.050	So, last class we have discussed about that effect of that different kind of losses, nozzle effect of nozzle cavity on sound spectrogram.
12.srt	00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.700	And we said that with derived that transfer function of the uniform tube single tube vocal vocal track.
12.srt	00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:47.369	Now, think about that see vocal track is a single tube model is ok. Now, can I find out that the radiation loss also we have find out the effect of radiation loss.
12.srt	00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:53.640	Now, think about that how the glottal will connected to the vocal track ok.
12.srt	00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:05.870	If you see here the air flow from lungs passes through the vocal cords and once it passes through the vocal cords the since the vocal cord create obstruction in the air flow.
12.srt	00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:17.210	And, due to this air flow the vocal cord is vibrating and that vibration create the sound and goes through the vocal track and produce the sound.
12.srt	00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.330	So, I can say whole vocal track can be the this is a systems.
12.srt	00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.640	So, I can say this if you see the diagram.
12.srt	00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.920	So, this is the vocal track model let us this is the vocal track model.
12.srt	00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.560	How we excited that model using the vocal cord vibration.
12.srt	00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.100	So, now vocal cord vibration can I electrically simulate like this way.
12.srt	00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:49.040	So, this is the air flow that means, the air pressure which is coming from lungs if the vocal cords are closed the pressure is increases.
12.srt	00:01:50.219 --> 00:02:06.689	Once it start opening that if the pressure that this increased pressure force air flow through the vocal cords opening and that air flow causes a vibration in the vocal cord and that vibration create the sound.
12.srt	00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.310	Now if I say.
12.srt	00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:17.140	if the if I say the if you know that particle volume velocity u is nothing, but a analogous to electrical current I.
12.srt	00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.180	So, if I say this is the vocal track which is a system and it is excited by a pressure which is coming from pressure is coming from P g lungs lungs pressure is excited the vocal track and that pressure sorry that lungs pressure will connect to will cause an particle velocity or volume velocity u in the vocal track.
12.srt	00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.550	So, that how do you make the word.
12.srt	00:02:47.550 --> 00:03:00.070	So, if I say the impedance of the vocal cords is nothing, but a resistance and inductive impedance that lets it is a l g and it is r g like the load ok.
12.srt	00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:09.200	So, now this pressure pass through that impedance and create a vocal cord or you can say volume velocity u g.
12.srt	00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.120	which is the input to the vocal tract system.
12.srt	00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:23.530	Now, if I say this vocal tract vocal cords is a time bearing vocal cords because vocal cord is closing and opening closing and opening.
12.srt	00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.430	So, once it is completely closed so completely closed means u g is equal to 0.
12.srt	00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:40.340	If it is completely closed no volume velocity because air is completely stopped flow is completely stopped.
12.srt	00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.759	So, no volume velocity u g is 0.
12.srt	00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.420	So, when this UG will be 0, if the impedance in here is infinite.
12.srt	00:03:49.550 --> 00:04:05.070	So, if I say let vocal chord opening AG is a function of T. So, opening of the vocal chord is a function of T, then impedance impedance is nothing but a 1 by AGT.
12.srt	00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.360	So, when the vocal chord are completely closed then AG opening AGT is equal to.
12.srt	00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.750	0 and that creates infinite impedance.
12.srt	00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:30.939	So, that there is although there is a pressure is there, but there is no flow, u g is 0 ok.
12.srt	00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:37.340	So, that is why that gotor closure impedance is infinite volume velocity is equal to 0.
12.srt	00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.019	Now, this analogy let us try to derive that ok.
12.srt	00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:57.800	I know the vocal track transfer function, I know the load condition or boundary condition at the lips which is the radiation load, I know the input condition vocal cords loading to the tube.
12.srt	00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.800	Now, can I implement that tube in a or in a circuits or in a digital domains or in a circuits?
12.srt	00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:12.089	So, let this is my vocal track, this is the vocal track.
12.srt	00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.779	uniform tube is the vocal tract.
12.srt	00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.519	So, here is an radiation load at the lip.
12.srt	00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:35.829	So, if this is my ZL radiation load in the, so this is x equal to 0, this is x equal to length, length of the vocal tract is L and here is the radiation load.
12.srt	00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:44.719	This side there is a some impedance in here and then there is a pressure source Pg.
12.srt	00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.699	So, this is the complete electrical model.
12.srt	00:05:51.399 --> 00:06:08.189	Now, if it is P g, it can be think this is P g. So, if I make it replaced by a current source which is nothing but a U g, current source is nothing but a U g, then this impedance come in parallel.
12.srt	00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:18.369	So, this is Z g and this is P g.
12.srt	00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.199	is the complete model.
12.srt	00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:36.569	Now, putting these two boundary condition, try to simulate this single tube vocal cord model.
12.srt	00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:44.779	So, if I say this vocal track, if I say this is my input volume velocity.
12.srt	00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:52.769	So, there will be output volume velocity, this is the there is a this is u you can say that this is u t u t.
12.srt	00:06:53.249 --> 00:07:11.339	u t plus 0 t this is u t minus plus you can say that l t this is u t minus and this is l t and this is u t 0 t minus.
12.srt	00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:16.499	So, this is a backward wave.
12.srt	00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:23.339	So, there will be a forward wave there will be a backward wave inside the tube which is u plus.
12.srt	00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:28.519	and which is u minus ok.
12.srt	00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:54.159	So, considering all those things can I derive this tube mathematical model of this tube considering two boundary condition ok. Now, so tube can acts nothing, but a delay tube is acting is nothing, tube acts nothing, but a delay let us forget about that part let us solve one by one boundary condition.
12.srt	00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.240	So, boundary condition at leafs.
12.srt	00:07:57.019 --> 00:08:04.839	So, I have a vocal track, this track has a boundary condition at leaf.
12.srt	00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:24.469	So, this is nothing but a Z L. So, this is nothing but a U minus L T here and this is U plus L T.
12.srt	00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:32.700	or I can say this current which is coming out it is nothing but a ULT.
12.srt	00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:39.360	Here it is U plus, here it is U minus and here it is U plus.
12.srt	00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:46.529	So, this ULT pass through this ZL and create PLT.
12.srt	00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:54.509	PLT is nothing but a P at LT.
12.srt	00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:18.069	is equal to nothing but a Z L into let us complete current U L T or I can say U T let us write that T track U T L T. So, now find out that boundary condition.
12.srt	00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:25.689	So, what is P L T pressure across the load.
12.srt	00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:41.149	pressure across the load is nothing but a Z L or you can say the Z L let us write Z L into U T L T. So, it is nothing but a Z L into what is U T L T?
12.srt	00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:56.379	U T L T is nothing but a U plus L T minus U T minus L T.
12.srt	00:10:00.149 --> 00:10:01.309	So, it is nothing but this one.
12.srt	00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:14.049	Now, if I say what is P L t at the output of the track P L t x equal to L in here and x equal to 0 in here.
12.srt	00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:24.590	So, at x equal to L P L t is nothing but a Z d into U t plus L t plus U t minus L t.
12.srt	00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:41.559	or not and these two things are equal because at here this pressure is equivalent to the pressure across the load.
12.srt	00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:57.559	So, in that case I can say Z d u t plus L t plus u t minus L t.
12.srt	00:10:58.409 --> 00:11:13.389	is equal to Z L u t plus L t minus u t minus L t is ok.
12.srt	00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:14.680	I can write down.
12.srt	00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:23.790	Now, I write down that what is u t L t. So, Z t into u plus u t plus t minus L by c.
12.srt	00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.590	plus u t minus t minus L by c is equal to Z L u t plus t minus L by c this will be plus sorry minus u t minus t plus L by c. Now from this equation if I want to find out u t minus T plus L by C. I want to find out that backward wave.
12.srt	00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:15.409	So, why if I want to find out backward wave, so let us all the forward wave term I can write one side and on the backward wave term I can write another side.
12.srt	00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:29.730	So, I can say Z D from here I can say Z D into U T minus T plus L by C this term will come.
12.srt	00:12:30.109 --> 00:12:41.399	plus Z L U T minus T plus L by C is equal to Z L into U T plus will be there.
12.srt	00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:22.350	So, Z L U T plus T minus L by C minus Z T into U T plus T minus L by C. So, I can say ut minus t plus lyc into Zd plus Zl equal to ut plus t minus lyc into Zl minus Zd.
12.srt	00:13:31.439 --> 00:13:35.359	So, I can write ut minus t plus lyc is equal to this is ZL minus ZT take the minus sign out.
12.srt	00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:45.500	So, minus ZT minus ZL divided by ZT plus ZL into UT plus T minus L by C or not.
12.srt	00:13:45.899 --> 00:14:03.379	Let us this whole things ZT minus ZL divided by ZT plus ZL ZT minus ZL divided by ZT plus ZL if I say this is nothing, but a RL.
12.srt	00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:35.840	If I write down this is nothing but a R L. So, I can write it is nothing but a minus R L u t plus t minus L by C. Now, if I say if it is this minus R L u t plus t minus L by C is ok.
12.srt	00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:40.509	So, this is like same that in if you see the slides it is nothing but the same.
12.srt	00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:51.509	So, it is minus R L into U T minus T minus L by C is ok. Now, what is the total current then?
12.srt	00:14:53.289 --> 00:14:59.309	What is U T or you can say the U L T?
12.srt	00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.139	What is U L T?
12.srt	00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:19.340	U L T is the current passing through Z L current which is passing through Z L which is nothing, but a ultimate volume velocity which is passing through these circuits.
12.srt	00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:50.680	So, it is nothing, but a U T L T. So, I can say U T L is nothing, but a U T plus T minus L by C minus U T minus t plus L by c. So, u L you can say u L t is nothing, but a u at L and t. So, u at L like this.
12.srt	00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.790	So, I can say I put that minus value in here.
12.srt	00:15:53.790 --> 00:16:03.950	So, u t plus t minus L by c minus again minus plus R L into u t plus t minus L by c.
12.srt	00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:37.360	So, I can say it is nothing but a 1 plus R L into U T plus U T plus T minus L by C sorry U T plus T minus L by C. So, this is nothing but a 1 plus R L. Now, if I want to draw the circuits, so what should be the electrical circuits or transmission line kind of circuits?
12.srt	00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:41.719	So, ULT so I can say let us this is the tube.
12.srt	00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:49.269	So, if I say the glottis producing a let us that there is a tube.
12.srt	00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:51.069	So, tube is nothing, but a delay.
12.srt	00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:54.479	So, if I say this is my vocal track.
12.srt	00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:58.359	So, vocal track has a forward wave and has a backward wave.
12.srt	00:16:58.849 --> 00:17:07.980	So, whole tube is nothing the volume velocity in here and volume velocity here let us the volume velocity expression will be different.
12.srt	00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:09.619	but let us it is delayed.
12.srt	00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:10.799	So, what will happen?
12.srt	00:17:11.049 --> 00:17:14.079	Let us I say this is a delay circuits for forward wave.
12.srt	00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:12.689	So, it is nothing but a U t plus 0 t ok. Let us after the delay I get U t plus L t ok. Then backward delay I have a backward let us this is U t minus L t backward wave and I can get here also backward wave which is u t minus 0 t. Now total output of this volume output volume velocity is nothing but a u L which is u L t which is nothing but a u t plus u t L t. So, u t L t What is the UTLT equation?
12.srt	00:18:12.689 --> 00:18:27.789	UTLT equation is 1 plus RL UT plus T minus L by C. So, it is UT T minus L by C. So, I can say it is multiplied by 1 plus RL and I get that value.
12.srt	00:18:30.699 --> 00:18:33.199	What is T minus T minus LT?
12.srt	00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:38.629	It is nothing but a multiply by the plus this one.
12.srt	00:18:38.929 --> 00:18:40.269	Multiply by the minus RL.
12.srt	00:18:40.649 --> 00:18:46.099	as per this equation this equation.
12.srt	00:18:46.099 --> 00:19:02.109	So, I can say it is multiply by the minus R L I will get this and this whole things is nothing but the delay is ok.
12.srt	00:19:02.369 --> 00:19:07.079	So, it is this is the boundary condition 1 plus R L multiply by this circuits.
12.srt	00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:12.490	So, this is the signal flow diagram I can say signal flow diagram is nothing but the 1 plus R L.
12.srt	00:19:12.889 --> 00:19:20.419	by U t L t here and here is minus R L and flow is this side backward wave flow is this side.
12.srt	00:19:22.209 --> 00:19:26.139	Now, consider if you see the slide it is like this.
12.srt	00:19:27.849 --> 00:19:41.399	Now, there is a condition if Z L is much much greater than 0 much much greater than 0 then R L is equal to 1.
12.srt	00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:44.990	If Z L what is R L?
12.srt	00:19:45.359 --> 00:20:13.980	R L is nothing but a Z D minus Z L divided by Z D plus Z L. Now, if I say that if Z L is much much greater than 0, then I can say R L is equal to this condition I will come later on this I will come after discussing the boundary condition I will come this Z L Z D.
12.srt	00:20:14.429 --> 00:20:16.839	this constraint scenario ok.
12.srt	00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:20.129	So, this is the at the leap condition.
12.srt	00:20:20.509 --> 00:20:26.549	Now, if I say the glottis side, if I discuss about the boundary condition at the glottis side.
12.srt	00:20:26.939 --> 00:20:47.559	So, I can say I know the leap side I know leap side is nothing, but a Z L which is Z L ok. Now, this side I have I have said the pressure source is replaced by a current source which is nothing, but a volume velocity which is U G 0 t.
12.srt	00:20:48.469 --> 00:20:54.399	or U g t here 0 is not here because x equal to 0 in here x equal to l in here.
12.srt	00:20:55.049 --> 00:21:09.589	Now, the impedance, got all impedance come in parallel then z g. So, signal flow is like this, this is the forward wave backward wave.
12.srt	00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:28.429	So, I can say that P g t total got all pressure is nothing but a p t 0 t the pressure across in here will be same in here also what all pressure.
12.srt	00:21:28.989 --> 00:21:32.949	Now, the current is nothing but a this is the total current.
12.srt	00:21:33.189 --> 00:21:42.649	So, some current will be flow this way and some current will be flow this way some current will be flow this circuits and some current will be flow this circuits.
12.srt	00:21:49.159 --> 00:21:57.579	So, I can say u t 0 t which is the velocity at the input of the vocal track is nothing, but a u g t minus.
12.srt	00:21:58.749 --> 00:22:18.419	So, this is the total pressure is P g t. So, total pressure is P g t divided by z g. So, this current if this this total pressure is P g t then the pressure divided by the load is the current.
12.srt	00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:20.929	So, this current will be minus from the total current.
12.srt	00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:24.789	is the current which will passing through this to the tube.
12.srt	00:22:25.049 --> 00:22:46.369	So, I can say volume velocity at the tube input is nothing but a total u g t the total volume velocity produced by the glottis minus the volume velocity which is passing through the load you can say the glottal load u z g. So, this total current minus the load current.
12.srt	00:22:46.589 --> 00:22:51.669	So, load current if the z g is the load and voltage is p g t then p g t is the z g is the.
12.srt	00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:54.079	current.
12.srt	00:22:54.319 --> 00:22:55.339	Now, what is P g t?
12.srt	00:22:55.569 --> 00:23:03.999	P g t is nothing but a P 0 t or I can say P 0 t or P t 0 t input track voltage.
12.srt	00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:07.579	So, pressure at vocal track input.
12.srt	00:23:07.949 --> 00:23:21.759	So, I can write U g t minus 1 pi z g into z t U t plus.
12.srt	00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:33.899	0 t plus u t minus 0 t or not.
12.srt	00:23:34.249 --> 00:23:52.809	So, I can write u g t minus z t divided by z g into u t plus t 0 plus u t.
12.srt	00:23:53.359 --> 00:23:58.379	minus t, x equal to 0, here x equal to 0.
12.srt	00:23:58.379 --> 00:24:04.419	So, from here what I have to find out?
12.srt	00:24:04.419 --> 00:24:16.889	Again I want to find out the what the volume expression of the volume velocity which is input to the track forward wave and the backward wave, then I can draw the circuits.
12.srt	00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:29.839	So, from there I want to find out u t plus t. From this equation I want to find out u t plus t. How do I do it?
12.srt	00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:56.129	So, u t 0 t here it is u t 0 t I write down u t 0 t means u t plus t minus u t minus t is equal to u g t minus z d divided by z g into u t.
12.srt	00:24:56.419 --> 00:25:15.349	t plus t plus u t minus t. So, from there I have to find out u t plus t. What will be the expression?
12.srt	00:25:26.739 --> 00:25:57.809	The expression will be like this u t I am not deriving it u t plus t will be u g t divided by 1 plus Z d divided by Z g into 1 minus Z d by Z g divided by 1 plus Z d by Z g into U t minus t. So, I can simplify it U g t plus U t and here also I can say U g t sorry there will be a plus this is not into.
12.srt	00:25:58.029 --> 00:26:18.319	So, if I simplify it, Zg into Ugt divided by Zg plus Zt plus Zg minus Zt divided by Zg plus Zt into Ut minus t.
12.srt	00:26:39.939 --> 00:27:00.719	Now, if I say Zg minus Zd divided by Zg plus Zd is equal to Rg, I say that this terminology this term is equivalent to Rg.
12.srt	00:27:00.949 --> 00:27:05.309	So, what is the value of Zg divided by Zg plus Zd?
12.srt	00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:13.379	So, Zg plus Zd will be 1 plus Rg.
12.srt	00:27:13.739 --> 00:27:16.499	Let us find out 1 plus R g by 2.
12.srt	00:27:17.249 --> 00:27:19.369	So, what is 1 plus R g by 2?
12.srt	00:27:19.509 --> 00:27:31.609	1 plus R g divided by 2 is equal to 1 plus Z g minus Z d divided by Z g plus Z d whole divided by half.
12.srt	00:27:32.619 --> 00:27:45.089	So, it will be Z g plus Z d plus Z g minus Z d divided by Z g plus Z d. So, Z d Z d cancel.
12.srt	00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:54.619	So, it will be 2 Zg divided by Zg plus Zd into half.
12.srt	00:27:56.459 --> 00:27:59.379	So, it is nothing but Zg divided by Zg plus Zd.
12.srt	00:27:59.869 --> 00:28:15.449	So, I can say this term Zg by Zg plus Zd is nothing but a so, I can say Ut plus T is nothing but a 1 plus Rg divided by 2 into Ug T.
12.srt	00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:29.819	plus R g u t minus t ok. Now, I draw the complete circuit of this side.
12.srt	00:28:30.259 --> 00:28:36.659	So, I can say seeing this equation I try to draw the vocal track circuits ok.
12.srt	00:28:36.989 --> 00:28:38.299	So, let us this is my tube.
12.srt	00:28:39.429 --> 00:28:45.989	So, again this is my delay in the forward wave, this is my delay in the backward wave.
12.srt	00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:48.689	I take this blue pen.
12.srt	00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:50.609	So, this is the delay circuit.
12.srt	00:28:52.069 --> 00:28:56.349	So, this delay circuits this is delay.
12.srt	00:28:58.589 --> 00:29:07.769	So, I can say this is u g is coming from here u g t is coming from here, got all volume velocity is coming from here.
12.srt	00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:17.909	So, if it has to be u t. So, if this is nothing, but a u t plus t u t plus t.
12.srt	00:29:18.249 --> 00:29:20.009	u t at that u t plus.
12.srt	00:29:20.349 --> 00:29:43.719	So, this is nothing, but a 1 plus R g divided by 2 multiply this plus backward wave has to be added here which one is nothing, but a R g. So, u t plus t is nothing, but a 1 plus R g by 2.
12.srt	00:29:44.499 --> 00:29:49.169	So, u g t multiply by 1 plus R g by 2 system diagram signal flow diagram.
12.srt	00:29:49.609 --> 00:30:14.389	plus delay this is nothing but a u t minus t R g and left side what I get if it is u t final output left side we get this kind of things which is nothing but a 1 plus R L and this is nothing but a signal flow diagram.
12.srt	00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:20.499	So, this will be the sign this is nothing but a minus R L has to be signed and this is nothing but a.
12.srt	00:30:20.849 --> 00:30:47.449	U t minus L t. This is nothing but a U t plus L t. So, if I consider whole tube is nothing but a delay and put these two boundary condition, now if I know R g and R l, I can derive the circuit diagram or transfer function also.
12.srt	00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:51.629	So, in digital circuits, how the delay is implemented?
12.srt	00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:59.029	this delay can be replaced by Z to the power minus n, n is the number of sample delay.
12.srt	00:30:59.549 --> 00:31:09.699	So, suppose I have a 17.5 centimeter long tube 17.5 centimeter long tube ok.
12.srt	00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:18.419	So, how much delay if the sound velocity is 35000 second 0 centimeter per second 350.
12.srt	00:31:22.299 --> 00:31:23.119	meter per second.
12.srt	00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:33.649	So, this so how much time sound will take from here from come from here to here 17.5 centimeter is the tube length.
12.srt	00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:41.799	So, time is distance divided by the velocity.
12.srt	00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:56.629	So, you can get it.
12.srt	00:31:57.039 --> 00:32:09.459	how much time will required to cover 17.5 centimeter if the velocity is v is velocity of c of the sound is equal to 3500 centimeter per second.
12.srt	00:32:10.589 --> 00:32:16.789	I can easily find out that things and once I get that things.
12.srt	00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:23.589	So, I can say this is 350 to 2 I can put one so this is 1 t by 2000.
12.srt	00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:26.259	So, I can say half.
12.srt	00:32:27.419 --> 00:32:41.739	0 or can say 0.5 half millisecond half millisecond 10 to the power 3 is half millisecond to 0.5 millisecond.
12.srt	00:32:43.399 --> 00:32:50.509	So, 0.5 millisecond time will take from tube come to here to here.
12.srt	00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:06.399	Now, if I say that in digital domain if this circuit I want to implement If it is sampled at 8 kilohertz, then single sample delay means 1 by 8 kilohertz.
12.srt	00:33:06.399 --> 00:33:08.849	This is a single sample delay.
12.srt	00:33:09.239 --> 00:33:12.689	So, 1 by 8 kilohertz, I think 125 microsecond.
12.srt	00:33:13.459 --> 00:33:15.269	Then how much delay will be required?
12.srt	00:33:16.879 --> 00:33:17.399	0.5 millisecond.
12.srt	00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:20.689	I can calculate the number of Z is required.
12.srt	00:33:20.689 --> 00:33:27.779	So, I can instead of delay, I put Z to the power that number of n. Delay will be simulated.
12.srt	00:33:28.719 --> 00:33:39.999	and I get the digital circuit if I know the R L and R G. So, next this kind of mathematics you can practice later on.
12.srt	00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:45.209	Let us then we discuss about the multi tube modeling.
12.srt	00:33:45.369 --> 00:33:49.229	So, next class we will discuss about the multi tube modeling.
12.srt	00:33:49.449 --> 00:33:53.059	So, single tube modeling we derive the signal flow diagram.
12.srt	00:33:53.329 --> 00:33:55.579	You do not have to remember it.
12.srt	00:33:55.579 --> 00:33:59.699	If you understand that things if you able to derive this equation.
12.srt	00:33:59.939 --> 00:34:07.989	then from the equation I can draw the signal flow diagram for a single tube model considering two boundary conditions.
12.srt	00:34:08.359 --> 00:34:19.479	Now, instead of a single tube if I consider that freeze production system is nothing but a multiple tube then what should be the transfer function and how do we implement it.
12.srt	00:34:19.879 --> 00:34:21.629	So, next class we will start there.
12.srt	00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:22.199	Thank you.
13.srt	00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.160	of the vocal track is not uniform throughout the tube.
13.srt	00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.870	Here a cross sectional area very small.
13.srt	00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:20.780	So, whatever the constriction is made the cross sectional area of the tube along the you can say the x equal to 0 to x equal to L at the left the tube cross sectional area is not uniform ok.
13.srt	00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:31.210	So, instead of a single uniform tube with a with a fixed cross sectional area which is a we have done instead of that.
13.srt	00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:40.020	Now, we want to make the model with a multiple tube of different cross sectional area connected to each other.
13.srt	00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:48.420	So, if I see let us this this kind of things that let us this is the glottis and this is the lips this is the structure of my vocal track.
13.srt	00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:02.200	Now I can say whole vocal track instead of modeling by a single uniform tube can be modeled as a multiple number of uniform tube connected with each other.
13.srt	00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:22.900	So, let us the whole track is modeled by n number of tube with a fixed length, length is fixed, let us the length is L. So, I can say this L k length tube and n number of tube is connected with each other.
13.srt	00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.590	So, I can say the vocal track is modeled like this way.
13.srt	00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:38.949	So, I can say L 1 or I initially I can say that whole vocal track can be modeled different number of connected tube or different length also.
13.srt	00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:50.089	So, if I say we will do that then I can say this is the L 1, L 2, L 3, L 4, L 5 number of this is the length of the tube and 5 number of tube is connected to each other.
13.srt	00:01:50.699 --> 00:02:09.629	Or I can consider L 1 equal to L 2 equal to L 3 equal to L 4 equal to L 5 then the length of the tubes are same, but n number of small tube I divided and whose cross sectional area is A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4, A 5 all are not same different cross sectional.
13.srt	00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.819	Now, if I consider that then what is the problem?
13.srt	00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.469	If I consider that whole the whole tube is a connected tube instead of a single tube.
13.srt	00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:32.199	So, the problem is that I know what will happen when it sound will travel throughout the tube ok.
13.srt	00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:43.579	If it is a single tube I know input and output it is in the tube actually nothing, but a delay I can derive the equation for signal flow equation from the input and output I can find out the transfer function of the tube.
13.srt	00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.579	There will be an effect at junction also.
13.srt	00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:58.849	So, the main purpose for multiple tube modeling is that I have to find out what happening at each and every junction of the tube.
13.srt	00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.250	So, the cross section let us this one is very small cross sectional area this is wide cross sectional area.
13.srt	00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.879	So, what will happen volume velocity and pressure wave equation in this junction what will happen all tube will be connected here this junction.
13.srt	00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.579	So, let us I want to know what will happen at k th junction.
13.srt	00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:24.609	So, kth junction is nothing but a kth tube and kth plus 1 tube junction that junction I want to know what will happen.
13.srt	00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:37.409	So, instead of single tube let us consider I have a tube the different different tube are connected with each other with different cross sectional area.
13.srt	00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.139	So, I let us the kth junction I taken.
13.srt	00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.829	So, this is the kth junction of the tube.
13.srt	00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:47.079	So, this is the k plus 1 tube.
13.srt	00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.009	and this is the kth tube this is the junction.
13.srt	00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:59.009	So, here if it is L k then here L this if I see this is a beginning of the kth tube.
13.srt	00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:06.159	So, x equal to 0 and here it is x equal to L k ok.
13.srt	00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.649	Here will be another junction.
13.srt	00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:12.859	So, I the let us solve for the single junction this will be replicated at every junction.
13.srt	00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:18.919	So, cross sectional area of this tube is a k this tube is a k plus.
13.srt	00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:49.199	it is nothing but a u k minus l k t and here it is nothing but a u k minus t. Input of this tube here forward wave is nothing but a u k plus 1 t, backward wave in here it is nothing but a u plus u k plus 1.
13.srt	00:04:49.579 --> 00:05:11.210	So, here I have written as a tau k why what do you mean by tau k if it is C this is nothing but a u k plus t minus tau k where tau k is nothing but a L k by C ok.
13.srt	00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:20.519	Here it is k plus 1 t here again it will be this will be nothing but a u k plus 1.
13.srt	00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:41.870	T minus tau k plus 1, where tau k plus 1 is nothing but a tau k plus 1 is nothing but a L k plus 1 divided by C. Backward wave same, I can say the backward wave like this way.
13.srt	00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.980	Now, I have to know what happening in the junction.
13.srt	00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:59.490	this junction what is happening what will happen in this junction ok.
13.srt	00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.050	So, this junction what will happen some I have to find out some.
13.srt	00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:15.240	So, if you if you see that if this is analogous to the water pipe also suppose there is a pipe water pipe different cross sectional area water pipe are joined together.
13.srt	00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.140	So, the water is flowing here some of the water if you this junction.
13.srt	00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:37.310	So, the volume velocity this point is the volume velocity which is injected in the second tube and the volume backward volume velocity in the kth tube is nothing, but a volume velocity which is injected due to the backward wave.
13.srt	00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.770	So, I have to find out the expression of the forward wave of the kth plus 1 tube and backward wave at the kth tube.
13.srt	00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.470	If I able to find out these two expression then I know.
13.srt	00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.360	So, what will happen in the junction I can draw the equivalent signal flow diagram at the junction.
13.srt	00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:15.890	So, my whole purpose is to find out how much forward wave is injected by the kth tube to the kth plus 1 tube and how much backward wave is injected by kth plus 1 tube to the kth tube that I have to find out.
13.srt	00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:38.250	So, I want to know the expression of u k minus t minus T plus tau k this is T plus tau k this one and I want to find out u k plus 1 T 1 u k plus this two expression I want to find out.
13.srt	00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:51.290	Now, what is the what is the what is the problem how do I find out that things ok.
13.srt	00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.770	So, how do I find out?
13.srt	00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.290	So, let us start that expression how to find out these two equations.
13.srt	00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.509	How to find out?
13.srt	00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:23.970	So, I can say that u k plus 1 x t any point u k plus 1 x t is nothing but a u k plus 1 plus t minus.
13.srt	00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:33.330	u k plus 1 minus t. What is x t at x equal to 0?
13.srt	00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:56.129	So, this will be 0 t. u k plus 1 or you can say p pressure wave p k plus 1 0 t is nothing but a z k plus 1 u k plus 1.
13.srt	00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:48.770	1 plus t plus u k plus 1 minus t at x equal to 0 at the k plus 1 tube at x equal to L at the kth tube u k plus u k at L kt end of the kth tube u k l k t is nothing but a u k plus T minus tau k where tau k is l k by C minus u k minus T minus T plus tau k or not.
13.srt	00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:27.529	And p k l k t is nothing but a z k into u k plus T minus tau k plus u k minus T plus tau k. Where Z k plus 1 is nothing but a rho c by a k plus 1 and Z k is nothing but a rho c by a k cross sectional area of the tube is a k.
13.srt	00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:29.820	or not?
13.srt	00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.220	So, I am not animation I am not showing the animation.
13.srt	00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:51.580	This is the 2 1 2 3 4 equation I will get.
13.srt	00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.220	I know what I have to find out.
13.srt	00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.900	I know I have to find out u k plus t plus tau k and u k plus.
13.srt	00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.340	T this I have to find out this is the 4 equation I get.
13.srt	00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:18.190	Now if I say this one is equal to this one or not.
13.srt	00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:38.230	The volume velocity which will input to the second tube is nothing but a volume velocity which is exited from the first tube.
13.srt	00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:46.549	So, the volume velocity which is exited from the kth tube will be the volume velocity which is the input of the k plus 1 tube.
13.srt	00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:59.370	So, I can say u kth tube volume output volume velocity is nothing but a u k plus t minus tau k.
13.srt	00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:26.919	minus u k minus t plus tau k which is equal to the volume velocity input of the k plus 1 t. So, it is nothing but a u k plus 1 plus t minus u k plus 1 minus is it ok or not.
13.srt	00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:34.500	Second one is that output pressure of the kth tube will be equivalent to the input pressure of the k plus 1 tube.
13.srt	00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.440	So, what is output pressure of the kth tube?
13.srt	00:12:38.920 --> 00:13:08.000	Zk u k plus 1 T minus tau k plus u k minus T plus tau k which will be equivalent to or equal to Zk plus 1 u k plus 1 plus u k plus 1 minus T. These are two equations.
13.srt	00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.920	I will get from the condition.
13.srt	00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:18.610	So, I said that if it is the my first tube and it if it is the kth tube and if it is the k plus 1 tube red one is the k plus 1 tube.
13.srt	00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:27.529	So, the volume velocity which is inject at the output of the kth tube will be the equal volume velocity at the input of the red tube.
13.srt	00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:37.480	Similarly, the output pressure of the black tube is equivalent to the output pressure of the red tube that is why I make ok.
13.srt	00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.570	If it is that.
13.srt	00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:44.190	Then, can I solve these two equations for these two?
13.srt	00:13:44.670 --> 00:14:08.409	I have to find out u k plus t and u k plus 1 t and u k minus t plus tau k. The amount of expression for the reflected backward wave at the kth tube expression for the forward wave k plus 1 tube.
13.srt	00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.990	These two things I have to deduce from these two equations.
13.srt	00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:28.130	Now, if I take this one, then I can say that this using these two equations, I can find out the expression.
13.srt	00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.530	I am not deriving, you can derive it and find out the expression.
13.srt	00:14:40.560 --> 00:15:02.129	So, the expression of u k plus 1 plus t will be 2 z k divided by z k plus z k plus 1 u k plus T minus tau k plus z k minus z k plus 1 divided by z k plus 1 u k plus 1 minus T.
13.srt	00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:54.680	And, u k minus T plus tau k will be minus z k plus z k plus 1 divided by z k plus z k plus 1 into u k plus T minus tau k plus 2 z k plus 1 divided by z k plus z k plus plus 1 into u k plus 1 minus t. This is the two expression I will get from these two equations.
13.srt	00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.670	Now, just try to simplify these two equations.
13.srt	00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:13.370	So, what I can write that if I write r k is nothing but a z k minus z k plus 1.
13.srt	00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:44.590	1 divided by Z k plus Z k plus 1 Z k minus Z k plus 1 divided by Z k plus Z k minus is nothing but a R k. If this is R k then I can say this expression u k plus 1 u k plus 1 plus t forward wave at the second tube will be or k plus 1 tube will be nothing but a 1 plus R k.
13.srt	00:16:45.570 --> 00:17:16.370	less this is small r k. So, this is 1 plus r k into u k plus t minus tau k plus r k u k minus k plus 1 minus t and u k minus t plus tau k will be equal to minus r k this one this one minus r k.
13.srt	00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:41.269	into u k plus t minus tau k plus 1 minus r k into u k plus 1 minus t. Now, try to draw the diagram at the junction point.
13.srt	00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.579	So, I want to draw the diagram at the junction point from these two equations.
13.srt	00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.420	Let us try in here only.
13.srt	00:17:48.639 --> 00:17:52.730	So, that would be little bit of equation are there.
13.srt	00:17:57.939 --> 00:18:06.439	So, now what I said I want to know let us this is the junction, this is the 4 point at the junction.
13.srt	00:18:07.069 --> 00:18:19.230	This is nothing but a u k plus 1 plus t and this is going this direction and backward wave is going this direction at the junction.
13.srt	00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:34.599	So, it is nothing but a u k minus t plus tau k. So, signal flow I can say this direction, this is the forward direction and this is the backward direction.
13.srt	00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:45.080	So, this is nothing but a u k plus t minus tau k and this is nothing but a u k plus 1 minus t. So, I can say u k plus or u k plus 1 t this is nothing but a 1 plus r k into so this signal multiply by 1 plus r k and it has to be go a signal from here which has to be added there which is nothing but a multiply by r k or not then I want to know this signal This signal is nothing but here which is there u k plus t minus tau k has to be multiplied by minus r k and this signal u k plus 1 t minus has to be multiplied by 1 minus r k. I get the junction diagram.
13.srt	00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:50.460	So, if you see that this is the junction diagram I have draw in here.
13.srt	00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.830	So, once I know these two equation.
13.srt	00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:02.130	I know the junction diagram 1 plus r k 1 minus r k. Then what is r k?
13.srt	00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.769	r k is called reflection coefficient.
13.srt	00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.710	How it is come?
13.srt	00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:09.830	What is z k?
13.srt	00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:25.620	Rho sheet by a k rho c by a k minus rho c by a k plus 1 cross sectional area of the a kth tube cross sectional area of the k plus 1 tube minus rho c by a k.
13.srt	00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.390	plus rho c by a k plus 1.
13.srt	00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:41.460	If I evaluate it, it is nothing but a a k plus 1 minus a k divided by a k plus 1 plus a k or not.
13.srt	00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:47.930	So, this is called that is why R k is called reflection coefficient.
13.srt	00:20:49.269 --> 00:20:57.490	It is nothing but a cross sectional area of k plus 1 tube.
13.srt	00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:07.080	minus cross sectional area of the kth tube divided by the cross sectional area of the k plus 1 tube plus cross sectional area of the kth tube.
13.srt	00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:28.000	So, the diagram so kth tube length is L k so delay is tau k. So, I can say whole diagram so kth tube length is L k. So, delay will be only tau k here also will be delay tau k.
13.srt	00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:59.380	and here is I get the input of the kth tube which is nothing but a u k plus t and u minus k t. Here is the delay of the k plus 1 tube tau k plus 1 and here will be delay of the k plus 1 tube tau k plus 1 and I can get that u k plus 1 plus t minus tau k plus 1 and here I get.
13.srt	00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:11.730	u k plus 1 minus T plus tau k plus 1.
13.srt	00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.500	So, this is the complete junction signal flow diagram.
13.srt	00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:42.000	Think about similar kind of junction is repeated instead of k I can say put 1 k varies from 1 to let us n. So, if there is a n number of tube then I can say k varies from 0 to n minus 1 to u varies from 0 to n minus 1 to u.
13.srt	00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:58.130	Now, I just consider the value of what should be the value of R k. The R k is a k plus 1 minus a k divided by a k plus 1 plus a k. Now, what is the maximum value of R k?
13.srt	00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.660	What is the maximum value will be?
13.srt	00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.710	of r k what is the minimum value of r k if a k is very small compared to a k plus 1 if i neglect a k then r k will be 1 if a k is very very big compared to the a k plus 1 or if a k is much much greater than a k plus 1 then i can say r k will be minus 1.
13.srt	00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:51.410	So, if the cross sectional area of the second tube is larger much larger than the first tube at the junction r k reflection coefficient will be plus 1.
13.srt	00:23:52.970 --> 00:24:03.250	If a k is less a k is a k is much much greater than a k plus 1.
13.srt	00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.470	1, then r k is minus 1.
13.srt	00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:15.330	If a k is a k plus 1 is much much greater than a k, then r k is plus 1.
13.srt	00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:29.680	So, this is 1 minus r k. If r k is plus 1, then if you see this signal reflected the backward wave is multiplied by this backward wave, effect of backward wave is multiplied by 0.
13.srt	00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.790	if is r k is minus 1 then 1 minus r k is positive.
13.srt	00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.290	So, minus 1 2.
13.srt	00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:51.020	So, this is the maximum value of r k will be either plus 1 and minus 1.
13.srt	00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.780	So, you can prove it that r k value make maximum value will be plus 1 or minus 1.
13.srt	00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:03.780	Now, suppose I have a kth n number of tube with equal length.
13.srt	00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.600	If I consider all tubes are equal length, then what should be the diagram?
13.srt	00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:20.360	So, I said this delay tau k, tau k is equal to tau k plus 1, if all tube length are, so what is tau k?
13.srt	00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:31.720	L k by c, so if all tube length are same, then I can say the tau k is equal to tau k plus 1, all are del x del x del x del x del x.
13.srt	00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.480	So, delay circuit will be same.
13.srt	00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.540	So, it is nothing but a delay, delay will be same, same delay will be happen.
13.srt	00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:54.080	Now, if it is that then I can say let us tau is equal to sampling period T 1, z to the power minus 1 is one sample delay, what is the delay?
13.srt	00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:00.710	If it is 8 kilohertz then what sampling period 1 by 8 kilohertz is the sampling period.
13.srt	00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.270	So, sampling period delay will be happen, let the tau T 1.
13.srt	00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.140	sampling period is equal to tau.
13.srt	00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.100	So, this is one sample delay one sample delay in here.
13.srt	00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.620	So, I can say this is replaced by z to the power minus 1.
13.srt	00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.840	So, if it is tau k is the delay.
13.srt	00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:35.400	So, tau k delay is replaced by z to the power minus 1 and tau tau tau tau is tau is the tau k is equal to tau k plus 1 is equal to tau and this tau is equal nothing but a sampling period is equal to sampling period.
13.srt	00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:42.220	So, in that case I can say the signal is one sample delay that is z to the power minus 1.
13.srt	00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:55.080	Now, considering the boundary condition I can derive the complete transfer function of this tube model in z domain then I can implement it.
13.srt	00:26:55.310 --> 00:27:06.870	So, next class what I want to do I want to derive the total vocal chord transfer function for a n such tube model n such tube model.
13.srt	00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:15.920	So, instead of you can say the single tube, I consider multiple tube of different cross sectional area are conjuncted with each other.
13.srt	00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:24.880	Let there is a n number of tube, then I derive the signal flow diagram for the single junction, the same junction will be repeated for n minus.
13.srt	00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.180	So, if there is a n tube, n minus 1 junction will be there.
13.srt	00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.780	So, n minus 1 junction will be there in the tube, this will be repeated.
13.srt	00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.830	Then I can say the delay can be simply implemented by sampling delay.
13.srt	00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:50.730	So, if I replace this tau k delay by z to the power minus 1 sample delay, then I have to find out the whole z domain equation of this vocal technos function.
13.srt	00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.290	So, next class I will try to do that.
13.srt	00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:53.840	Thank you.
20.srt	00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:19.379	So, last class we are discussing about the zero crossing.
20.srt	00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:26.910	So, we are saying that suppose I have a simple sinusoidal simple sinusoidal.
20.srt	00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:45.629	So, every cycle every cycle a simple cytosine channel cross the 0 line 2 times and if it is DC shifted, let us correct the DC shift then find out the 0 crossing.
20.srt	00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:54.329	2 times it cross the 0, so 2 time per cycle ok.
20.srt	00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:58.849	So, for every cycles it cross the 0 line 2 times.
20.srt	00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.930	Now, if the sampling frequency is let us F s and the cycle that fundamental frequency of what this signal frequency is F 0.
20.srt	00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:17.310	So, for every cycle it cross the 0 line 2 time.
20.srt	00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:26.469	So, sampling rate F s. So, if how many cycles are there in per sample?
20.srt	00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.769	So, F s samples are there by F 0 sample per cycle.
20.srt	00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.019	So, for every cycle.
20.srt	00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:37.419	how many samples are there.
20.srt	00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.799	So, if F s is the number of sample and F 0 is the frequency.
20.srt	00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:50.229	So, F s by F 0 sample will be there per cycle which I have discussed already.
20.srt	00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.469	So, two time per cycle.
20.srt	00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.219	So, every cycle how many samples are there F s by F 0 every cycle.
20.srt	00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.739	So, cycles is equal to F s by F 0 sample.
20.srt	00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.669	So, if I convert this to number of 0 crossing per sample.
20.srt	00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.849	So, I can say 2 into it will be cycle convert to sample.
20.srt	00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.359	So, it will be F 0 by F s because cycle is 2 by cycle 2 pass cycle.
20.srt	00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.689	So, it is nothing but a 2 by F s by F 0.
20.srt	00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:36.549	So, it is nothing but a 2 F 0 by F s number of 0 crossing.
20.srt	00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.469	per sample.
20.srt	00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:59.219	So, I can say for a pure sinusoidal the number of zero crossing per sample is 2 f 0 by f s. So, suppose I said find out the number of zero crossing of a sine wave for 80 sample or for m sample.
20.srt	00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:15.870	So, I can say the number of zero crossing for M sample is nothing but a 2 into F 0 divided by F s into M is clear.
20.srt	00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:30.469	So, now suppose I have a signal 1 kilohertz signal F 0 is equal to pure tone of 1 kilohertz sampled at F s 10 kilohertz.
20.srt	00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.889	If I say find out the number of zero crossing for 40 or 400 sample.
20.srt	00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:44.519	How many times signal cross the 0 line for 400 sample?
20.srt	00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:54.719	So, I can say it is nothing but a Z 400 is equal to nothing but a 2 into F 0 by F s into 400.
20.srt	00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:05.469	So, I can say 2 into 1 kilohertz means 10 to the power 3 divided by 10 into 10 to the power 3 into 400 cancel.
20.srt	00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.370	So, it is nothing but a 80.
20.srt	00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:31.810	So, 0 crossing for 400 samples is 80 number even instead of 400 sample I said how many time signal will cross the 0 line for 30 millisecond 30 millisecond in a 30 millisecond signal how many time signal cross the 0 line.
20.srt	00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:39.769	So, if we say F s is 1 kilohertz that means, 1 millisecond has 1 k sample or 10 k sample.
20.srt	00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.819	So, 1 millisecond has 10 sample.
20.srt	00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.420	So, 30 millisecond has 300 sample.
20.srt	00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:58.580	So, instead of 400, I can say 2 into 1 k divided by 10 k into 360 number.
20.srt	00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.600	So, I can find out the number of zero crossing.
20.srt	00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.569	Okay.
20.srt	00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.650	Now, Now, instead of sine wave let us I have a speech signal.
20.srt	00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:21.960	So, it is not a I cannot say two times per cycle.
20.srt	00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:32.300	So, I have a R b signal I do not know number of cycles which is the period I do not know anything there is a signal only.
20.srt	00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.519	I want to know how many times signal cross the zero line for a 40 millisecond.
20.srt	00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.470	segment or of a 20 millisecond segment for one window.
20.srt	00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:56.360	So, my problem is that I have to find out how many times signal cross the zero line for 20 millisecond I take a window.
20.srt	00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.280	So, that is why it is called short term zero crossing rate.
20.srt	00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:11.129	If I want to calculate how many times signal cross the zero line entire signal that can also I calculate, but that will be not used because a signal which is time varying.
20.srt	00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.780	So, this may be voice, this may be silence, this may be noise.
20.srt	00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.290	So, all kinds of steps signals are there.
20.srt	00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.490	If I want to know the which part is voice, which part is noise.
20.srt	00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.210	So, I have to instead of taking the whole signal at a time, I have to take a small window.
20.srt	00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.490	Same as calculation of energy that is why you call short term zero crossing rate.
20.srt	00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.750	So, once I make a short term, let us 20 millisecond window.
20.srt	00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.510	I want to find out how many times signal will cross the 0 line.
20.srt	00:06:49.540 --> 00:07:03.270	Here my formula will not work because I do not know where the cycle number of cycle F 0 I do not know, F s I know, I know only F s sampling frequency I know, I have sample the signal something else.
20.srt	00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:13.150	Now, let us this is an x n is a signal first I explain it then I put the generalized formula.
20.srt	00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.770	So, this is the first window.
20.srt	00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:29.430	this is the first window and signal is x n. So, x n is 20 millisecond signal if f s is equal to 8 kilohertz then how many sample will be there in 20 millisecond 10 millisecond 80 sample.
20.srt	00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.840	So, I can say there will be a 160 sample value.
20.srt	00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:42.740	So, x n has an 160 value if it is so if it is start from 0 then it will be x 159.
20.srt	00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.980	Now, I want to find out how many times signal cross the 0 line.
20.srt	00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.280	So, if I say if I generally drawn suppose those are the sample.
20.srt	00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:06.460	So, when the 0 crossing will be happened this is a sample once a signal sample will come this side.
20.srt	00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.460	So, this is the positive sample this is the negative sample.
20.srt	00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.900	So, there will be a 0 crossing.
20.srt	00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:19.180	Similarly, there is a negative sample negative sample then once it is a positive sample then there will be a 0 crossing.
20.srt	00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:38.090	So, I can say the zero crossing only happen if the signal value signal or sample sample sign in change positive to negative sign.
20.srt	00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:44.620	So, every time when a previous sample if it is positive next sample is negative zero crossing occur.
20.srt	00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.360	Previous sample is negative next sample is positive zero crossing occur.
20.srt	00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.180	So, I can say let us I compare where the.
20.srt	00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.540	So, there is a zero crossing will be occur in between two sample.
20.srt	00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.390	So, within this two sample I have to find out whether there is a zero crossing occur or not.
20.srt	00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.170	So, how do I find out?
20.srt	00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:11.810	I have to check within this two sample whether the sample value change the sign or not.
20.srt	00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.900	So, I can check let us this is x 0 and this is x 1.
20.srt	00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:27.980	So, what I define let instead of x 0 x 1 let us write it 1 1 minus 1 minus 1.
20.srt	00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:18.370	So, I can say if x n is greater than 0 then let us I define a function S n g of x n will be 1 or or else else if else or or you can write or S n g x of n equal to minus 1 if x of n is less than 0.
20.srt	00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.290	So, if x of n is less than 0 then the value of S n g of x n is minus 1 and this is 1.
20.srt	00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:46.470	So, if I see this sample this is 1, this is 1, this is minus 1, minus 1, minus 1, 1 ok. Now, if I say so I have to check 2 sample at a time I have to check 2 sample at a time.
20.srt	00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:54.730	So, I can say if this minus this if both are 1.
20.srt	00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.480	So, 1 minus 1 is equal to 0.
20.srt	00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.140	If the sign is changed then only I want one count.
20.srt	00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:16.920	So, I can write down a function that Z n less than 0 crossing count of 0 crossing is nothing, but a change of sign S n g of x.
20.srt	00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:34.090	So, sample 1 so that means, x of n plus 1 or if I write then minus x of n minus 1 previous sample sin of so I will use the separate side.
20.srt	00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:55.180	So, sin s n g x n n minus s n g of x of n minus 1 previous sample then take the mod give me the every time.
20.srt	00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.600	So, if I take the mod of this function what will give?
20.srt	00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.290	this is plus 1.
20.srt	00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.340	So, this in this case this is minus 1.
20.srt	00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.250	So, let us this case this case I have taken also come in here.
20.srt	00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:13.430	So, this case so x 3 minus and I take x 2.
20.srt	00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.010	So, I taking the x 3 and x 2.
20.srt	00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:19.860	So, this is x 3.
20.srt	00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.590	So, if it is x 3 x 3 is negative sample.
20.srt	00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.670	So, minus 1 minus x 2 is positive sample.
20.srt	00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:35.830	1 minus 1 then take the mod then the value will be 2.
20.srt	00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:43.260	If it is 1 and 2 value of 2 second sample is positive.
20.srt	00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:50.750	So, 1 value of first sample is positive equal to 1 take mod 0.
20.srt	00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:59.050	So, if I take this function and check for all sample take the sum.
20.srt	00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:06.520	So, every time signal cross the 0 line I get the value of 2.
20.srt	00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.700	So, what I want?
20.srt	00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:15.500	I want number of 0 crossing through the that window let us this is the L root 20 millisecond.
20.srt	00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:25.620	So, I can say this will be 1 by 2 has to be normalized because 0 crossing is number 1 number 2.
20.srt	00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.670	So, instead of number 1 every time in this function I get value 2.
20.srt	00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.380	So, 2 has to be normalized.
20.srt	00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:42.620	Now, if I want to normalize with respect to window length, then I again normalize with L. This is for first window.
20.srt	00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.360	So, same thing will happen for any window throughout the signal.
20.srt	00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.340	So, generalized formula for calculating the zero crossing rate is this one.
20.srt	00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.980	And this is the block diagram.
20.srt	00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.560	First signal pass through the minus 1 and 1, I make it, then take the difference.
20.srt	00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.630	take the mod then I pass through the window and get the.
20.srt	00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.660	So, what I get for every window I get a z value.
20.srt	00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:19.480	So, for the window number 1 I get a z 1 for window number 2 I get a z 2 for window number 3 I get a z 3.
20.srt	00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.200	So, how many if there is a 100 frame per second.
20.srt	00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.690	So, I can get 100 z value.
20.srt	00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:32.920	So, instead of fs I can get 100 points of z value ok.
20.srt	00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.560	So, fs is 1 second.
20.srt	00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.930	the 1 second is divided into 100 point.
20.srt	00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:52.020	So, now sampling frequency come down to the instead of F s it is 100 sampling rate the frame rate divided that sampling frequency.
20.srt	00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.270	So, I get a 1 value here 1 value here that way 100 value I get.
20.srt	00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.910	So, 100 z value I get then if I plot those 100 z value.
20.srt	00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:12.460	So, if the signal is sibilant or if the fricative So, if I see the example, if the sibilant signal, so number of zero crossing will be much high.
20.srt	00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.010	So, z corresponding window z value will be very high.
20.srt	00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:22.520	If it is signal is voice, signal is voice kind of signal, number of zero crossing will be less.
20.srt	00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.640	So, z value will be low.
20.srt	00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:35.220	So, depending on the z value, I can say whether this signal is sibilant or this signal is silent.
20.srt	00:15:37.490 --> 00:16:01.390	The problem is that even though the signal is non-sibling let silence, but there is a simple noise is there then also I can get the zero crossing rate very high or less there is a 50 hertz frequency fine the line frequency disturbance then also I get the zero crossing rate with the like the voice signal.
20.srt	00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:08.550	So, that is why the zero crossing rate is not a you cannot say this is a very rigid parameter.
20.srt	00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:17.900	for detecting the voiced or unvoiced detection, but yes I can do the voiced unvoiced detection using zero crossing rate.
20.srt	00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:24.190	So, normalized zero crossing rate means it is normalized with respect to window length.
20.srt	00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:48.090	So, if it is so I can say normalized zero crossing rate is z is equal to nothing but 1 by 2 L summation of m let us x m sorry mod of S n g of x m minus x of m minus 1 s n g will be there mod.
20.srt	00:16:48.940 --> 00:17:09.970	Now, if I want to put the w in pictures normal value then m will be n minus l plus 1 and here will be n and here will be n minus m. So, I have said that nth window nth window.
20.srt	00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.740	equal to 0, n equal to 1, n equal to 3, n equal to 4.
20.srt	00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:28.820	So, I know the which window it is path and for each window I calculate the normalized zero crossing rate with respect to 2 L, here is the L is the length of the window.
20.srt	00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:42.820	So, let us I have a signal, let us this same see this example for a 1 kilohertz sine wave as a input using 40 millisecond window length with various value of sampling frequency.
20.srt	00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:52.800	we get the following, we get the same value of Z m. So, window length is 320.
20.srt	00:17:53.960 --> 00:18:10.630	So, if we know that Z 1 is nothing but a 2 into F 0 by F s and if it is multiply for particular 40 millisecond, then I know how many sample will be there in 40 millisecond and I can find out the Z value.
20.srt	00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.720	If it is C, the Z value is same, Z m is same.
20.srt	00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.450	but Z 1 is different.
20.srt	00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:33.670	Per cycle for per sample the number of 0 cosine per sample is different, but number of 0 cosine for a particular number of sample is same for particular number of time sorry particular number of time is same.
20.srt	00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:45.050	So, this is I can say Z m is independent of or I can say the Z m is independent of sampling frequency that is called.
20.srt	00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.210	normalize zero crossing rate.
20.srt	00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:56.650	Then there is another parameter we said time domain parameter is called auto correlation coefficient.
20.srt	00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:06.860	The details I will discuss during LPC analysis and F 0 analysis, but I just give you a hints what is auto correlation that idea.
20.srt	00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.650	So, what is a correlation?
20.srt	00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:18.150	You know suppose I want to find out the correlation between these two things that is nothing, but a similarity.
20.srt	00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.920	between the two object is called correlation, similarity between these two object.
20.srt	00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:31.780	If two object are similar then I can the similarity is similarity I have to measure the degree of similarity.
20.srt	00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:37.830	So, there is a requirement of some parameter with respect to which I can find out the degree of similarity.
20.srt	00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:50.610	So, suppose it is a digital signal x n another digital signal y n I have to find out the similarity between this signal and this signal.
20.srt	00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:58.300	So, what I will do for every sample similarity of the whole signal.
20.srt	00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:11.840	So, similarity number 1 or 0 I have to find take the one sample of this signal, take the first sample of this signal, take the product, then take the sum.
20.srt	00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:22.170	So, it is nothing but a product x n multiplied by y n. Now, if I find out the similarity of degree 1 or 1.
20.srt	00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.890	So, what I will do?
20.srt	00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.030	I will shift the one signal by one sample.
20.srt	00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.240	So, that is the correlation.
20.srt	00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:43.240	So, if it is autocorrelation, then y n is equal to x n. It is similarity between the signal itself.
20.srt	00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:50.790	So, in that case, the r 0 first coefficient is nothing but a x n square.
20.srt	00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.320	Each sample has to be square.
20.srt	00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.070	and then sum up.
20.srt	00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.820	So, it is nothing but a energy T 0.
20.srt	00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:13.580	Similarly, if it is R 1, so the signal is same signal is shifted by 1 then multiply.
20.srt	00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:29.740	So, x 1 the x 0 will be multiply with next x 1 here x 0 is not x 1 x 0 x 1 is treated as a 0 and last sample will be multiply with the 0 because if I take the outside the vicinity of the window signal is 0.
20.srt	00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:37.920	1, then I get a value, then I get a value r 2, then I get a value of r 3 just shifted.
20.srt	00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:58.420	So, if I shifted it, if you think in a sine wave manner, let this is a sample, this is a sample, this is a sample, this is a sample, this is a sample, this is a sample, again sine wave 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
20.srt	00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.050	Now, once I multiply this with this, I get with this, this with this, this with this and add it.
20.srt	00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:09.550	Similarities maximum I get E 0.
20.srt	00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:15.970	Once I shifted the sample with once, so next time I extract this sample.
20.srt	00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:25.720	Then I multiply this with this, this with this, this with this and this with this, this with this and take the sum.
20.srt	00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:34.410	Now, if you see since there is a signals are not similar not in phase, you can say the signal is not in phase.
20.srt	00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:45.670	So, in that case the similarity becomes reduce again it will multiply with the same signal when it will come in here.
20.srt	00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:55.020	So, after complete one period again the signal once this same kind of similar kind of signal will multiply each other.
20.srt	00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.860	So, summation will be increases.
20.srt	00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:06.310	So, I can say r 0, r 1, r 2, r 3 if I calculate those r value with respect to different l.
20.srt	00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:22.660	So, again I get the maximum value at r l where l represent the time of or f t or l is equal to nothing but a length of the signal where it is complete period it has a complete period.
20.srt	00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.920	So, l is nothing but a t complete period.
20.srt	00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.390	So, if we plot the signal I am not coming this details I will cover it will look like this.
20.srt	00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.420	So, if you see the red color is the maximum.
20.srt	00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:37.010	So, maximum occur.
20.srt	00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.260	at red color.
20.srt	00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.660	So, what is the definition of a fundamental frequency?
20.srt	00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.270	Signal repeat itself.
20.srt	00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.850	So, when it will be repeat?
20.srt	00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.530	If the sample value was similar.
20.srt	00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:55.220	So, I can say the signal repeated in here, signal repeated in here, signal repeated in here.
20.srt	00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:01.050	So, this is nothing but a f 0, this is nothing but a twice f 0, this is nothing but a thrice f 0.
20.srt	00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:07.650	So, that can be used to calculate the fundamental frequency of the signal.
20.srt	00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.980	So, that is auto correlation parameter for time domain processing.
20.srt	00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.920	Details again I will discuss during the F 0 extraction.
20.srt	00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:34.210	Next is called average magnitude difference function A M D F. Instead of taking the multiplication of the signal, I just take the mod, magnitude difference mod, mod of the magnitude difference.
20.srt	00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.930	So, suppose I have a X 1 take the x 0 minus x 0 take the mod.
20.srt	00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.660	Then instead of x 1 x 0 take let us x k and n plus k. So, I can say n equal to 0 to capital N minus 1 minus k which is nothing but a d k. So, I can say difference number 1.
20.srt	00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.250	So, k equal to let us 0.
20.srt	00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:30.630	So, I take the difference between the x 0, I take the difference of first sample with all other sample and their sum.
20.srt	00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.050	Then I have to show there is n number of sample.
20.srt	00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:39.940	So, I can normalized it 1 by n. So, I take n number of sample signal.
20.srt	00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.190	Then, take the difference.
20.srt	00:25:42.780 --> 00:26:00.640	So, this is there is a n number of signal in my signal and take the first sample and take collect the difference of the first sample with other sample and take the sum and divided by n. Now, see the philosophy.
20.srt	00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.630	If this is my x 0, let us my x 0 is in here.
20.srt	00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:10.770	So, I take the x 1.
20.srt	00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:15.400	take the difference of x 1 is in here let us x 1 value is here.
20.srt	00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:21.500	So, if I if I say x 1 x 2 x 3 I take the differences.
20.srt	00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:34.240	So, differences will be minima when the value of this one this x 0 which matched with similar kind of period will come.
20.srt	00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.670	If you see if we take the plot I take this first sample.
20.srt	00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:51.160	I take this first sample, take the difference between this sample, this sample, this sample, this sample, this sample, this sample, this sample, and sum.
20.srt	00:26:53.810 --> 00:27:01.180	Then take this sample, then take this sample with difference of this sample, this sample difference of this sample, this sample difference of this sample.
20.srt	00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:13.680	So, x 0 minus x of n which n varies from 0 to n minus 1 k. So, k equal to 0 means x x x 0 minus x 0.
20.srt	00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:20.350	x 0 minus x 1, x 0 minus x 2, x 0 minus x 3, I am taking it and take the sum.
20.srt	00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:31.550	Then I take x 1 minus x 0, x 1 minus x 2, x 1 minus x 3, x 1 minus x 3 and take the sum.
20.srt	00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.290	So, if I do that way, when it will be minimum?
20.srt	00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:43.430	When I take the difference from here, same signal and the same signal.
20.srt	00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.170	So, x 0 minus x 0.
20.srt	00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:59.050	So, this is nothing but will look like a x 0 although it is not x l. So, it is x k when x k minus x 0 is equal to 0 then the difference will be minimum almost 0.
20.srt	00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:10.170	So, I can say the definition of a phase is that if the two samples are identical after n delay then n is called period.
20.srt	00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:16.740	So, the if you know that x of n is equal to x of n plus n.
20.srt	00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:34.280	So, x of n after n sample if the same sample is appear then I can call the period of the signal is x n. So, difference will be minima when the signal repeat itself.
20.srt	00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.720	So, if I say this kind of plot I will get.
20.srt	00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:47.370	So, first minima will occur at f 0, second minima will occur at twice f 0, third minima occur thrice f 0.
20.srt	00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:57.440	So, details I will discuss that what are the extraction of F 0, what is the drawback of this algorithm or all things.
20.srt	00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.500	So, this is called average magnitude difference.
20.srt	00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:12.370	So, all those time domain parameters can be used to detect the speech and suppose I want to detect the speech and non speech.
20.srt	00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.260	So, what is the important?
20.srt	00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:21.880	If I not talk suppose I want to develop and feature speaker identification systems.
20.srt	00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:28.790	and I want to find out where the speech event is started and where the speech event is ended.
20.srt	00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:34.400	So, let us I quiet for some time and start recording.
20.srt	00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:44.140	I want to find out the time when I start speaking and when I end speaking, speech and non-speech.
20.srt	00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:50.660	So, beginning of speech interval and ending of a speech interval that I have to detect.
20.srt	00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.680	So, how do you detect it?
20.srt	00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:05.490	I have to accurately locate the beginning and end of the speech with a noisy background something will be there.
20.srt	00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.330	So, those kind of things will be there.
20.srt	00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:08.680	So, what is the problem?
20.srt	00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:24.050	Suppose there is a some noise and I start the speech with a plausible consonant po to co this kind of consonant.
20.srt	00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.490	If you see the occlusion period of paw is nothing but a silence.
20.srt	00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.390	So, I do not know where the paw is started.
20.srt	00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:40.240	Because when it start voicing I know here the voicing is started.
20.srt	00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:48.250	So, that is nothing but a paw to next voicing transition, but I do not know where the paw is begin whether it is begin in here or whether it is begin in here I do not know.
20.srt	00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:55.610	Similarly, if there is a some fricative weak fricative like paw.
20.srt	00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.780	then also detection of that fricative is very tough.
20.srt	00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:12.710	So, weak plosive, fricative, weak fricative even nozzle suppose you started a nozzle consonant the voicing is started like this and suddenly like this.
20.srt	00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:22.370	So, where exactly it is started it may be coincide with the noise ok.
20.srt	00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.880	So, those are the problem in voicing and non voicing detection.
20.srt	00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:38.970	But, using this energy or you can say the average magnitude and zero crossing rate, I can detect the voice beginning and end point of the voicing.
20.srt	00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.960	So, what I will see?
20.srt	00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:45.940	If you see this is a log energy separated voice from unvoiced and silence.
20.srt	00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:56.680	So, this is the silence, this is the unvoiced, this is the voiced log energy in dB.
20.srt	00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:03.320	This is the zero crossing, silence, unvoiced and voiced.
20.srt	00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:10.050	Zero crossing for 10 millisecond interval, so I take the window side is 10 millisecond.
20.srt	00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.100	So, suppose I can develop an algorithm like this.
20.srt	00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.430	This is my energy, so I can get the interval, this is the, this block line is plotted for every 10 millisecond, every 10 millisecond there is a point.
20.srt	00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.230	So, I can say I can explain it better here.
20.srt	00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:40.390	So, suppose I have a signal then silence.
20.srt	00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.320	So, now, what is this one?
20.srt	00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.750	So, what I do?
20.srt	00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:55.790	I take for every 10 millisecond, I find out the average magnitude or I can say that average magnitude a m or I can find out the e m energy.
20.srt	00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:56.910	Okay.
20.srt	00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:05.410	and 0 crossing rate for every 10 millisecond I get that one.
20.srt	00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.310	So, if it is 1 second signal if it is 10 millisecond is the frame rate.
20.srt	00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.720	So, I can get a 100 frame value.
20.srt	00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:13.620	So, coincide with the signal.
20.srt	00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:25.710	So, I can say this frame corresponding to this energy, this frame corresponding to this energy, this frame corresponding to this energy, this frame corresponding to this so I can get a energy plot like this.
20.srt	00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.680	Now, if I have to define a threshold.
20.srt	00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:45.270	So, that if it is within this threshold value then I call it is a silence if it is above the threshold value then I call it is a voice.
20.srt	00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:57.100	So, I normalize the amplitude because you are recording then you say that if I record in high volume then threshold value will be change.
20.srt	00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:21.520	So, what you will do you can normalize the speech signal with respect to some sample you can say that this is the maximum level of So, I get a signal I normalize the amplitude of that whole signal and take find out the threshold value from some previous study and adjust the threshold value to find the voice and unvoice detection.
20.srt	00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.860	Similarly, for every 10 millisecond I get a Z m value.
20.srt	00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.190	So, if it is noisy so Z m value will be very high.
20.srt	00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:34.130	So, I can get the Z m plot will be look like this again down down down.
20.srt	00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.130	So, again I can say the Z m value if it is high above this threshold value.
20.srt	00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:43.869	I can say it is a sibilant below this threshold value I can say it is a voiced or silent.
20.srt	00:34:44.709 --> 00:34:54.829	If there is a silence can also have a high threshold value, but if you see the Z m and energy if I combine then I can say whether it is a silence or sibilant.
20.srt	00:34:55.139 --> 00:35:03.399	Sibilant amplitude will be high at least voicing sibilant there will be some power, but in silence only background noise will be there.
20.srt	00:35:03.579 --> 00:35:04.649	So, power will be reduced.
20.srt	00:35:04.939 --> 00:35:11.379	So, that way I can find out this parameter can be used for voicing and unvoicing detection.
20.srt	00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:20.830	For PDA and VDA, voice detection or PDA can PDA and VDA I discuss later on the pitch detection algorithm and voice detection algorithm.
20.srt	00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:26.330	So, this can be act as a voice detection algorithm, but every PDA is nothing but a VDA.
20.srt	00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:31.490	If I able to find out the pitch, pitch is exist only for voicing signal.
20.srt	00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:36.450	So, I can say VDA PDA is exist only for voice detection.
20.srt	00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:42.170	So, VDA PDA pitch detection algorithm, VDA voice detection algorithm.
20.srt	00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:48.170	So, I will discuss those later on details of when we discussing about the F 0 extraction.
20.srt	00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.120	So, time-loan methods is complete.
20.srt	00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:54.540	So, next class I will discuss about the LPC modeling.
20.srt	00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:55.510	Thank you.
18.srt	00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:33.310	So, last class we have discussed about the perception of amplitude or you can say the perception of intensity that is loudness and how how the loudness is converted into dB, what is 0 dB, what is equate loudness curve, what is shown curve that we have discussed.
18.srt	00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.009	Today we want to discuss about how human being perceive the frequency.
18.srt	00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:51.979	If you see that we have a pitch, we generally call the pitch of this sound is very high, pitch of this sound is very low, your pitch is very high pitch.
18.srt	00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:53.289	So what is pitch?
18.srt	00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:03.820	So pitch is a perceptual parameter whereas the frequency which is related to the pitch is the physical parameter.
18.srt	00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:12.209	Frequency can be measurable, but pitch is a physiological parameter which is perceptually measurable.
18.srt	00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.049	So, this is a perceptual parameter.
18.srt	00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.899	So, pitch and frequency are not same.
18.srt	00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:23.939	If I say pitch is a perceptual of the perception of the particular frequency.
18.srt	00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:31.389	If the frequency is not in a pure tone, then the pitch may be different from the frequency like that.
18.srt	00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:44.810	If I give an example you have added that suppose There is a harmonium and there is a guitar, there is a let setar, there is a string, different kind of string instruments are there.
18.srt	00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.829	Every instruments are playing the let us the bass sa which is a particular frequency, let us 250 hertz frequency.
18.srt	00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:04.219	But if you perceive the sound, you can easily understand which one, which sound is coming from guitar, which sound coming for setar, which sound is coming from other string instrument.
18.srt	00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.740	So that means The perception of frequency is not as that the physical frequency.
18.srt	00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:24.390	So pitch is mainly a perceptual dimension of the frequency and pitch mainly corresponding to the fundamental frequency but not it is one to one corresponds.
18.srt	00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.629	Let us we have to interest that human being as suppose human being perceive the frequency.
18.srt	00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.210	Yes we perceive the frequency.
18.srt	00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.250	How good we perceive the frequency?
18.srt	00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.920	That means.
18.srt	00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.379	In which scale, how you perceive the frequency?
18.srt	00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.479	So suppose I have a x-axis, there is a scale physical frequency in hertz.
18.srt	00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:54.280	Now I want to know if I perceive the frequency, what is my resolution power?
18.srt	00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.500	In which scale a human being, normal hearing human being perceive the frequency?
18.srt	00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.430	So that scale is called male scale.
18.srt	00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.590	What is logarithmic scale?
18.srt	00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.069	male scale.
18.srt	00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.150	How it is derived?
18.srt	00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:37.900	Now suppose I do a perception test that I varying the frequency of a pure tone signal and playing the signal in a normal audio microphone in a loudspeaker sorry loudspeaker and I told the listeners when you perceive that the frequency is double then raise your hand like that.
18.srt	00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.800	amplitude.
18.srt	00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.919	So, I can develop a scale on which human being perceive the frequency.
18.srt	00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.150	If you see it will come look like this.
18.srt	00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:55.289	So, this scale is called male scale which is a logarithmic scale, ok.
18.srt	00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.710	So, I can say the human perception of frequency that I can derive by experiment.
18.srt	00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.590	This axis the frequency.
18.srt	00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.990	So, I generate a pure tone of different frequency and I generate a pure tone.
18.srt	00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:17.569	Suppose I generate a pure tone of 50 Hz, then I said that you raise your hand when you perceive the frequency is double.
18.srt	00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:32.459	So let us it is come around 100 Hz, then I just 55 Hz all kind of variation I play and he raise in here, raise a hand in here, raise hand in here, like here, then maybe here, then maybe here.
18.srt	00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.019	So from that point I can draw a curve and find out that the perception of the human or you have a frequency person or human is not linear.
18.srt	00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:57.939	Initial period may be up to 500 hertz to some 500 hertz its scale is linear, but after that it becomes a non-linear scale ok.
18.srt	00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.089	This scale is called male scale.
18.srt	00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:09.759	So, in male scale I can derive I can derive the mathematical equation of this curve and the male scale it will pitch in male there is two equation I can use any one of them.
18.srt	00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:18.889	like 3322 log 10 1 plus f by 1000 or 1127 log e 1 plus f by 700.
18.srt	00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:24.199	So, this equation is actually fitting this curve.
18.srt	00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.759	So, this equation is called Peets-Meyle scale, Meyle equation, okay, Peets in Meyle scale.
18.srt	00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.050	So, suppose I have f is equal to 2 kilohertz, then I can find out what is the value of the f in Meyle scale.
18.srt	00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.269	So, I can put that Peets in Meyle scale.
18.srt	00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:54.810	Let us pitch in male scale, male is equal to 1127 log let us E 1 plus 2 kilohertz 2000 divided by 700.
18.srt	00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.639	So, I can find out the male frequency.
18.srt	00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:11.870	So, this is called male scale you can say male scale conversion of the hertz to perception of the frequency.
18.srt	00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:27.399	Next, you have, I have discussed it during that basilar membrane that we perceive that each sensor along the basilar membrane is corresponding to a particular band of frequency.
18.srt	00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:35.849	So that means the ear cannot distinguish the sound within the same band that occur simultaneously.
18.srt	00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:44.039	Suppose a cochlear that along the basilar membrane particular band of frequency is perceived by a one sensor.
18.srt	00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:51.149	So, if within this band if the frequency occur, then I cannot distinguish the difference between the two frequencies.
18.srt	00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:58.319	So, this band is called critical band, critical band.
18.srt	00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:10.259	So, the auditory system can be roughly model as a filter band consists of 25 overlapping band pass filter which is varies from 0 to 20 kilohertz.
18.srt	00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:20.339	So, that band so I can say instead of human auditory systems, I can think about engineering model of some band pass filter.
18.srt	00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:34.939	whose frequency bands are non-linear and 25 overlapping non-linear band pass filter non non-linear bandwidth band pass filter can be completely modeled the human auditory system.
18.srt	00:07:35.109 --> 00:07:41.229	Then bandwidth of each critical band is about 100 hertz ok.
18.srt	00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:54.839	So, signal below 500 hertz it is linear and If it is increased above 500 hertz, it becomes non-linear.
18.srt	00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:58.569	So that bandwidth is defined as a bark.
18.srt	00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:04.419	So one bark is equal to width of a critical band.
18.srt	00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:07.099	So bandwidth in bark scale.
18.srt	00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:33.459	So bark scale is equal to f by 1000 if f 500 hertz, 9 plus 4 log 2 f by 1000 sorry 100 1000 if it is f is greater than 500 hertz.
18.srt	00:08:35.109 --> 00:08:42.989	So, that means, within 500 hertz bandwidths are 100 hertz bandwidth with overlapping if it is 50 percent overlap.
18.srt	00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:48.879	So, that is a band 100 hertz bandwidth then from 50 hertz another 100 hertz bandwidth.
18.srt	00:08:49.219 --> 00:08:52.799	So, up to 500 hertz bandwidth are linear 100 hertz.
18.srt	00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:56.689	After 500 hertz, the bandwidth is non-linear.
18.srt	00:08:56.689 --> 00:09:05.389	So I can find out how many critical band is required to cover the 0 to 20 kilohertz.
18.srt	00:09:08.009 --> 00:09:10.740	So that bandwidth is called Bach scale.
18.srt	00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:16.740	So those are the critical band, pictures of critical band.
18.srt	00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.490	And again I will discuss when we think about the MFCC kind of things.
18.srt	00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.879	So, Bach scale.
18.srt	00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:28.620	Next, another phenomena is called frequency masking.
18.srt	00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:32.949	So, perception of frequency and another is called masking.
18.srt	00:09:33.819 --> 00:09:39.000	So, what I said the human being has a threshold of hearing.
18.srt	00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:44.189	So, threshold of hearing curve I can say this is the frequency and this is the threshold of hearing.
18.srt	00:09:46.359 --> 00:09:54.769	Now, it is said that presence of a particular tone if some tone is present in here.
18.srt	00:09:54.929 --> 00:10:15.000	So, I cannot perceive if it is this this tone is not present I can perceive this frequency, but since this tone is present and if I have a frequency amplitude of like this I cannot perceive it, it require a amplitude to cross this limit ok.
18.srt	00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:24.009	So, that then that means I can hide this frequency because of presence of this strong tone.
18.srt	00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:38.269	phenomena is called frequency masking and this is utilized in speech coding to hide the coding, hide the noise.
18.srt	00:10:38.609 --> 00:10:47.109	So, suppose the coding generate a noise, if the noise is within this limit then I can say this noise is not perceivable.
18.srt	00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:51.859	So, to hide this noise frequency masking is much more useful.
18.srt	00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:58.439	I am not going details about the frequency masking, there is a lot of details on frequency masking.
18.srt	00:10:58.869 --> 00:11:03.719	So, if you are studying the speech coding, then auditory masking is very important.
18.srt	00:11:05.479 --> 00:11:08.219	Next one is different view of auditory perception.
18.srt	00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:11.469	So, there is a I can say the auditory perception has a two view.
18.srt	00:11:11.469 --> 00:11:18.899	One is called functional view, which is means which means suppose I cannot know what is happening in here.
18.srt	00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:23.369	I cannot do the anatomy and I cannot biological system, I cannot measure.
18.srt	00:11:23.939 --> 00:11:30.139	But you might consider the human head or human auditory system perception is nothing but a black box.
18.srt	00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:36.679	which I discussed in the first class, then I can say I can stimuli the systems.
18.srt	00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:45.679	So, I can excite the system by a known stimulus and then I can measure the physiological behavior coming out from the system.
18.srt	00:11:45.909 --> 00:11:53.819	Like that for the clear the development of shown scale or male scale is the example of functional modeling.
18.srt	00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:56.999	Another one is called structural modeling.
18.srt	00:11:57.349 --> 00:12:00.369	That one the study of physiology.
18.srt	00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:10.059	or anatomy, how various body parts work with emphasis of or emphasize on the process, neural processing of sound.
18.srt	00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.299	So, this is another kind of study.
18.srt	00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:24.870	The structural study, I have to analyze a human anatomy, excite the signal, measure the nervous signal, all kind of things can be done which is called structural analysis.
18.srt	00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:32.370	So, I can say the functional analysis like that how human being perceive the frequency in the functional modeling.
18.srt	00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:37.539	I play a different sound and a human being listen the sound.
18.srt	00:12:37.539 --> 00:12:51.679	So, I excited the human perception by external stimulus which is non stimulus and observe the output then can develop try to develop the how human being perceive the frequency that scale that is male scale.
18.srt	00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.269	So, that is functional kind of auditory perception.
18.srt	00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:06.179	Second one is that why we have to know the perceptual modeling or how human being perceive the frequency.
18.srt	00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:18.210	So, perceptual effect include the most auditory model, spectral analysis on a non-linear frequency scale, spectral amplitude compression, loudness compression via logarithmic scale.
18.srt	00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:29.590	So, we are not, we are not, you can say that physical loudness is not, physical intensity is not equivalent to the perceptual loudness.
18.srt	00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.330	So, there is a logarithmic compression is there.
18.srt	00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:44.879	Decrease sensitivity at lower frequency, you know that lower frequency are very, we are sensitive to the lower frequency, but higher frequency average, that is the bandwidth, critical bandwidth, critical bandwidth is very big.
18.srt	00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:53.410	So, average, so resolution, human resolution of the higher frequency is very rough, I can say roughly approximate.
18.srt	00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:05.460	So, I can say decrease sensitivity at lower frequency and increase sensitivity at, decrease sensitivity at lower frequency or you can say the change of perception of the frequency and lower bandwidth.
18.srt	00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.029	is much linear and the upper bandwidth is non-linear.
18.srt	00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:12.840	Then utilization of temporal features and auditory masking of tones.
18.srt	00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:32.440	So, those phenomena can be used in auditory modeling or when we extract the speech parameter from the speech, we have to include this perceptual variation so that the parameter directly represent the human speech percept, what we have done in the inside the ear.
18.srt	00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.019	So, that is called perceptual modeling.
18.srt	00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:37.720	So, the different auditory models are available.
18.srt	00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:45.340	Perceptual linear prediction, this is called PLP, only known as PLP.
18.srt	00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.390	So, these details I will cover during the linear prediction analysis.
18.srt	00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.480	This is called perceptual class linear prediction.
18.srt	00:14:53.010 --> 00:15:02.030	Then, SNP auditory model, lion cochlear model, gamma tone filter bank model or inner ear or inner hair cell model.
18.srt	00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.810	So, all are called auditory modeling of human speech processing.
18.srt	00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.420	So, let us I just discuss one or two model and then you can study it.
18.srt	00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.820	So, one model is that SNP auditory model.
18.srt	00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.850	If you see what is auditory model?
18.srt	00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:26.690	So how human being perceive the speech sound I have to implement in auditory model.
18.srt	00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:32.120	If you see there is a so stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3.
18.srt	00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.310	So what is stage 1?
18.srt	00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.410	What we have done?
18.srt	00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.430	We have a series of basilar membrane filter.
18.srt	00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.950	So I can say I can develop a.
18.srt	00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:50.320	a basilar membrane filter by a filter bank non-linear filter bank.
18.srt	00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.720	So, there is a pre-filtering.
18.srt	00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.060	Pre-filtering means since it is a digitized signal.
18.srt	00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.930	So, what I can do?
18.srt	00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.690	I can develop a pre-filtering after ADC.
18.srt	00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:14.810	So, that high frequency and low frequency signal are cut up and then I pass the signal through a band pass or you can say the chunk of band pass filter which is called basilar membrane or you can say critical band filter.
18.srt	00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.240	So, critical band filter band.
18.srt	00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:30.150	So, I have a speech signal, I pass this speech signal, let us forget the pre-filtering, pass this speech signal through a various frequency band filter.
18.srt	00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:41.390	So, each filter output or you can say the critical band filter output give me the response of a basilar membrane filter band each sensor.
18.srt	00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:46.500	Now, I have to know which sensor is firing.
18.srt	00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:52.529	I have to define which, so this is called the hair cell firing.
18.srt	00:16:52.889 --> 00:17:02.589	So this hair cell firing I have to find out which filter is firing based on the collected energy at the output of the each filter band.
18.srt	00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:09.389	So what this, so second stage is called you can say the modeling of hair cell.
18.srt	00:17:09.889 --> 00:17:11.589	So this is called hair cell modeling.
18.srt	00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:17.119	So half wave rectifier rectification for find out the energy then short term.
18.srt	00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:29.509	adaptation, synchrony residence, now rapid AGC, automatic gain control, then I can get the envelope detector mean rate spectrum and synchrony detector synchrony spectrum.
18.srt	00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:37.259	So I get a spectrum how human being perceive frequency at the output of this stage.
18.srt	00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.920	So details are here, stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 you can read.
18.srt	00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.950	So this is nothing but the idea is that I have a input speech.
18.srt	00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:59.190	I pass through that is a chunk of band pass filter which is actually critical band filter and each filter output is nothing but a sensor response.
18.srt	00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:09.029	So I calculate the response and I have to adjust that firing throughout that you can say the amplitude compression that part has to be done.
18.srt	00:18:09.309 --> 00:18:17.789	So that part I have done and I estimate the firing of the hair cell to perceive the frequency that is called SNP auditory model.
18.srt	00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.650	through a chunk of filter.
18.srt	00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:25.319	So, that is 86 cochlear filter bank here it is designed.
18.srt	00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:30.859	86 cochlear filter bank in male or box scale.
18.srt	00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:37.910	Then it is passed to the half wave rectifier to detect the amplitude.
18.srt	00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:48.170	Then AGC automatic gain compression to find out the frequency response of this acoustic signal as per the auditory response of the signal.
18.srt	00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.130	human being.
18.srt	00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.130	Then there is another model.
18.srt	00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.490	So, this is the lion's cochlear.
18.srt	00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.190	This I will come later on spectrogram.
18.srt	00:18:55.789 --> 00:19:00.380	Then ensemble interval histogram E I H model.
18.srt	00:19:01.289 --> 00:19:04.450	So, the model of cochlear hair cell transduction.
18.srt	00:19:04.819 --> 00:19:10.730	So, I can say this along the bocellar membrane there is a lot of there is a cochlear hair cell sensors.
18.srt	00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.150	Each sensor consists of 10 fiber.
18.srt	00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:24.200	So, that E I H ensemble interval histogram is nothing but a model of cochlear hair cell transduction.
18.srt	00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:32.079	This transduction, this motion how it is transduced this motion to the transduction is done place take place that is model here.
18.srt	00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:33.259	How it is model?
18.srt	00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:45.880	165 channel equal space on a log frequency scale between 150 to 700 hertz 150 channel filter sorry 165 channel filter.
18.srt	00:19:51.819 --> 00:20:04.019	So, each cochlear filter design match neural tuning curve of for CATS minimum phase filter array of level crossing detector that model motion of neural activity transduction of the inner hair cell and then we sum it and get the response.
18.srt	00:20:05.519 --> 00:20:24.240	Details you can also study if it is required then cochlear filter design how it is designed then EHI response overall EHI response that is EHI measure the spatial extent of coherent neural activity across.
18.srt	00:20:24.509 --> 00:20:26.690	of auditory nerve.
18.srt	00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:42.139	So, this kind of auditory models are mainly we use that PLP that we will discuss during the linear perceptual coding LP when we discuss the LPC that time we discuss the PLP details.
18.srt	00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:48.240	Now, why this auditory models are important in human speech perception?
18.srt	00:20:48.879 --> 00:20:50.629	So, non-linear frequency scale.
18.srt	00:20:50.629 --> 00:20:56.960	So, suppose I have a speech signal I extract the parameter in linear frequency scale.
18.srt	00:20:59.459 --> 00:21:09.999	Then physically I am doing is okay that I can extract the physical frequency, but how human being perceive that is important also to incorporate.
18.srt	00:21:10.379 --> 00:21:19.989	So if I want to incorporate that then all this frequency scale of the signal must be non-linear which is logarithmic scale either in male scale or box scale.
18.srt	00:21:19.989 --> 00:21:27.879	And spectral amplitude, dynamic range, timber is an important parameter.
18.srt	00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:34.229	So, spectral amplitude, dynamic range or compression or loudness log.
18.srt	00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:38.099	So, if I see each tone has an amplitude.
18.srt	00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:48.699	Now, perception of that tone, that particular frequency depends on the threshold of hearing.
18.srt	00:21:49.589 --> 00:21:54.969	So, perception of amplitude for all frequency is not same.
18.srt	00:21:57.689 --> 00:21:59.909	I have to go through the equal loudness curve.
18.srt	00:22:01.869 --> 00:22:08.859	So, I can say spectral amplitude compression as per the equal loudness curve I have to do.
18.srt	00:22:10.359 --> 00:22:18.129	So, I can dynamic range or amplitude of the spectrum has to be compressed as per the threshold of hearing.
18.srt	00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:26.689	The hearing sensitivity of the human ear to the amplitude is not same or not equal to all frequency.
18.srt	00:22:26.949 --> 00:22:30.489	So, as per the sensitivity is changing along the frequency.
18.srt	00:22:31.299 --> 00:22:36.639	that sensitivity changing has to be model in spectral envelope also or equal loudness curve.
18.srt	00:22:37.449 --> 00:22:40.129	Log spectrogram integration temporal features.
18.srt	00:22:40.809 --> 00:22:45.049	So, I can say the temporal features is very important in a speech signal.
18.srt	00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:52.809	How the spectral dynamics is changing is also a part of a speech signal, also a features of a speech signal.
18.srt	00:22:52.979 --> 00:22:55.699	So, that is also very important for speech perception.
18.srt	00:22:56.649 --> 00:22:58.129	Timber is one of the examples.
18.srt	00:23:02.869 --> 00:23:22.779	Suppose, I am producing a signal, somebody else is producing a signal, same signal is or same thing suppose that example I have already given that suppose I am singing a song which is follow the same notation, same lyrics, same you can say the duration is also same I exactly copy my guru, but if you see the guru's sound my sound cannot be equal because of complexity of the speech.
18.srt	00:23:23.109 --> 00:23:28.919	So, dynamic of the spectrum is very much important to know the complexity of the speech.
18.srt	00:23:29.289 --> 00:23:34.959	Then what to learn from the auditory model?
18.srt	00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:50.039	If I see Once I say the speech, that if I say segmental and supra-segmental, I can say that speech is not a stationary signal.
18.srt	00:23:50.039 --> 00:23:51.119	It is not a pure tone.
18.srt	00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:52.129	It is a stationary signal.
18.srt	00:23:52.129 --> 00:23:54.059	So it changes along the time.
18.srt	00:23:54.059 --> 00:24:03.569	If I take a short duration, 20 milliseconds, for a, let us say for a phone, and long duration for a speech segment.
18.srt	00:24:03.569 --> 00:24:08.889	So along the time, property of the speech signal is changed.
18.srt	00:24:10.939 --> 00:24:14.029	So, dynamics of the speech signal is changed.
18.srt	00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:28.889	So, I can say 20 millisecond is also the parameter from the 20 millisecond is also in some kind of parameter we can get and from long interval also we can get some kind of parameter which is also important for speech processing.
18.srt	00:24:31.739 --> 00:24:34.659	So, temporal structure is very important for.
18.srt	00:24:34.949 --> 00:24:43.869	So, I can say that speech contain both kind of information not only the segmental information supra segmental information.
18.srt	00:24:44.179 --> 00:24:46.709	across the segment information is very much important.
18.srt	00:24:47.539 --> 00:24:48.609	You can do an experiment.
18.srt	00:24:48.969 --> 00:24:55.339	Suppose you get a speech signal, you record a speech signal and find out the fundamental frequency for this segment.
18.srt	00:24:56.379 --> 00:24:58.539	Let us the fundamental frequency 200 hertz.
18.srt	00:24:59.149 --> 00:25:09.409	Design a filter or you can say that I can let us 0 to 200 hertz, design a 0 to 200 hertz filter, low pass filter, cut the signal.
18.srt	00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:15.459	Again if you play the signal, you still perceive that 200 hertz is the fundamental frequency.
18.srt	00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:18.129	How you got?
18.srt	00:25:18.449 --> 00:25:24.399	That means spectral dynamics told you is the 200 hertz is the fundamental frequency.
18.srt	00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:34.609	So, along the spectrum is also important and you can see the segmental and suprasegmental both information are necessary.
18.srt	00:25:35.049 --> 00:25:37.849	So, dynamic features is also necessary.
18.srt	00:25:37.949 --> 00:25:41.179	The how the spectral dynamics is changed that also is necessary.
18.srt	00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:47.159	So, dynamic features is changed in the importance compression of loudness.
18.srt	00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:55.959	of the scaling of the frequency all are important which is learned from the speech perception.
18.srt	00:25:55.959 --> 00:26:01.379	So, in summary I can say how you perceive the intensity?
18.srt	00:26:01.379 --> 00:26:02.659	Intensity is a physical parameter.
18.srt	00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:07.869	So, how intensity related to the speech loudness is important.
18.srt	00:26:08.559 --> 00:26:14.859	How the frequency which is a physical parameter is related to the perception of the pitch of the signal.
18.srt	00:26:15.259 --> 00:26:20.269	So, human perception of frequency, human perception of loudness.
18.srt	00:26:20.649 --> 00:26:32.359	and their mathematical model will be used in speech processing so that my parameter extraction when I go it should follow the human auditory systems.
18.srt	00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:36.189	So, that is called speech perception.
18.srt	00:26:36.959 --> 00:26:37.499	Thank you.
19.srt	00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:23.010	So, last class we have finished that speech perception that part.
19.srt	00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.260	So, let us start with time domain methods in speech processing.
19.srt	00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.070	So, here we want to discuss about some methods.
19.srt	00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.950	are in time domain methods.
19.srt	00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:44.359	Now, we are not analyzing the frequency of the speech in time domain methods for speech processing and that is used many cases those kind of methods are used ok.
19.srt	00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:51.620	So, now, first of all that one things is that once the speech is digitized and taken into the computer.
19.srt	00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.380	So, these are we are saying that digital signal processing the speech signal is now in digital domain.
19.srt	00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.570	So, we always denote the speech signal with x of t.
19.srt	00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:10.409	So, that is a digital signal we know the sampling frequency of x n let us is f s ok.
19.srt	00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:33.030	So, now speech if you see the speech is a time varying signal that means, along the time if this is the time axis then speech property has been changed this may be voiced that may be unvoiced then there may be a voice there may be noise then there may be a voice again then there will be a noise like that.
19.srt	00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:37.260	So, speech is not a stationary signal.
19.srt	00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:47.260	So, what I say that if I take this portion of the speech the property is different if I take this portion of the speech property is different ok.
19.srt	00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.000	So, speech is changing along the time.
19.srt	00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.300	Now, what happened suppose I want to find out the energy of this whole signal.
19.srt	00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.370	So, I can easily find out energy E is nothing but a summation of n equal to minus infinity to infinity.
19.srt	00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:16.199	x square of n whole signal whatever the signal is there I can take that whole signal at a time x square n that is the energy.
19.srt	00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.650	Now, if I take that energy then if I want to know that this portion is voice.
19.srt	00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:36.109	So, energy of this signal is high this portion is unvoiced energy is low this portion is noise energy is low compared to this this is high this portion again voice it is high.
19.srt	00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.500	So, if I want to know that information, if I take the whole signal at a time and find out the energy.
19.srt	00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:49.569	So, it give me the average energy or if I make it average then 1 by I can make the average also.
19.srt	00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:55.049	So, if I make the average, so I can get either total energy or average energy of the whole signal.
19.srt	00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:08.039	So, that information is whole signal energy is ok, but that does not give me any kind of parameter by which I can process or I can use this those parameter.
19.srt	00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.699	through some purpose in the speech processing.
19.srt	00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:27.099	So, what we have done instead of doing that whole signal at a time, we try to analyze the signal for a particular window, for a particular signal, for a particular segment.
19.srt	00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:38.029	Now, this segment I take this segment and find out the parameters and move to the next segment, next segment, next segment, then I can get a segment.
19.srt	00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.329	So, if this is my FAS.
19.srt	00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:41.869	frequency.
19.srt	00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.679	So, rate of sample in 1 second I get F s number of sample.
19.srt	00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.809	Now, if I window the signal let us 20 millisecond window.
19.srt	00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.719	So, 1 second signal how much frame I will get?
19.srt	00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.519	50 frame I will get if I slice the whole signal in a 20 millisecond window.
19.srt	00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.219	So, I get the 50 slice.
19.srt	00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:10.939	So, I have a 1 second signal I slice it every 20 millisecond.
19.srt	00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.039	So, I get 50 slide.
19.srt	00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.459	So, then I can say this is F s by 50.
19.srt	00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.819	So, it is F s by 20.
19.srt	00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.099	So, instead of F s sampling rate now for every window I get some parameter.
19.srt	00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:37.819	So, parameters are sampled at 20 millisecond per second means 50 some 50 window per second.
19.srt	00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.779	So, instead of F s number of sample now I get if each window represent is one sample then I get 50 sample.
19.srt	00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:58.779	Now, the problem is that if I do that things, then what will happen since this boundary in this boundary effect will come in the processing.
19.srt	00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:05.109	So, there may be a this boundary I just this boundary may be fall in a very large signal.
19.srt	00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.919	So, that this sample is included this window and this window energy will be less.
19.srt	00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.719	So, what I want to know I want to remove this boundary effect also.
19.srt	00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:18.049	So, then what will do?
19.srt	00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:26.889	I may take 20 millisecond window, but I slide the window let us 50 percent overlap.
19.srt	00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.809	So, effectively 10 millisecond sheet.
19.srt	00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:41.149	So, I can say frame rate in here is in 1 second then I get 100 frames.
19.srt	00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:49.699	So, if it is frame rate is FR, then I can say that if it is 10 millisecond sliding of the window, I take the window 20 millisecond.
19.srt	00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.429	but if I slide it 10 millisecond then I get 100 frame in a second.
19.srt	00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:59.529	So, frame rate is 100 frame per second.
19.srt	00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.049	Here sampling frequency I get F s number of sample per second.
19.srt	00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:14.079	Now, if I say for every 10 millisecond I take a point then I get 100 point in 1 second signal.
19.srt	00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:16.479	So, I can say it is down sample the signal.
19.srt	00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.019	So, if I want to process the signal.
19.srt	00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:25.899	taking every sample is very difficult because, if it is 8 kilohertz 8 k sample.
19.srt	00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:36.629	So, instead of 8 k sample, let us I divide that whole 1 second signal in a 100 frame and 100 frame for every 10 millisecond, I get a parameter.
19.srt	00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:38.099	Now, slide the window.
19.srt	00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:45.169	So, effectively what I am doing, I am windowing the signal with overlap methods.
19.srt	00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:51.629	So, this is window length, let us let us 20 millisecond and this is frame shift.
19.srt	00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.609	10 millisecond.
19.srt	00:06:53.829 --> 00:07:06.149	So, 0 to 20 millisecond I take the signal, I process it, find the parameter, I find out the parameter vector, let us vector a, let us it is x 1 or let us a vector 1.
19.srt	00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:16.289	Then I shift the window with 10 millisecond and again take the 20 millisecond, I find out a 2, a 2 vector.
19.srt	00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:20.799	Then I again shift the 10 millisecond and take 20 millisecond a 3.
19.srt	00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:23.179	So, in that case I will get a 100.
19.srt	00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:29.159	So, if I write like this way a 1, a 2, a 100 data I will get.
19.srt	00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:33.809	Why I take this one?
19.srt	00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:38.629	Why I take 20 millisecond, 10 millisecond?
19.srt	00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:42.439	Why I take this kind of statement or what is the logic behind it?
19.srt	00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:48.769	Now, if you see time speech is an time variant signal.
19.srt	00:07:53.299 --> 00:07:59.189	So, if I say that the time along the time signal change its color.
19.srt	00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:12.089	So, if I want to increase the time resolution, I should analyze the signal for every sample, but that analysis does not provide me any information.
19.srt	00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:13.769	So, what I want?
19.srt	00:08:14.069 --> 00:08:18.279	I want a small window let us 5 to 10 millisecond if I shift it.
19.srt	00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:23.429	So, for 5 to 10 millisecond window very short signal.
19.srt	00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:34.240	So, due to small amount of data, now if you see the pitch, let us I have taken 5 millisecond window.
19.srt	00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:44.090	Now, it may found that within 5 millisecond, may be one or two fundamental period is there.
19.srt	00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:47.919	If it is male voice, then may be 1.5 fundamental period is there.
19.srt	00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:51.620	So, if I analyze it, it is no use.
19.srt	00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.960	Now, if I take it.
19.srt	00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:04.020	let us 100 millisecond then what will happen I may lose the transitory portion of a consonant to vowel transition because speech is changing.
19.srt	00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:11.810	So, let us there is a co vast then v o t you know that that conclusion vast v o t transition.
19.srt	00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.320	Now, if I take a 100 millisecond my window may fall around here.
19.srt	00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:27.150	So, what is the information which is very important to know this information I lost this information because this information is taken an average with the vowel.
19.srt	00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.750	and some part of the consonant.
19.srt	00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.930	So, I lose the transitory part.
19.srt	00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:40.879	So, instead of 100 millisecond, so if I small amount signal processing problem, large amount signal I lose the time resolution.
19.srt	00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.070	So, what I want?
19.srt	00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:49.410	I want a optimum length of the window, so that it does not effect so much.
19.srt	00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:59.370	So, I can say let us 20 to 25 millisecond of window if I take, then one transitory period roughly 40 millisecond.
19.srt	00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:05.450	to 60 millisecond, maybe even faster speech it may be a 30 millisecond.
19.srt	00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:13.740	So, at least I can ensure that my window length is lower than the transitory part ok.
19.srt	00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:23.639	So, then I can say yes that details signal information we along the time I can find out if I take the window length 20, 25 millisecond.
19.srt	00:10:23.909 --> 00:10:31.330	So, that is why if you say in whole processing of the speech we use 20 to 25 millisecond.
19.srt	00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:37.959	as a window length and shifted the frame by 10 millisecond.
19.srt	00:10:38.230 --> 00:11:02.980	So, that I get 100 frame per second you can shifted it 15 millisecond also, but what will happen for every 15 millisecond I get a vector in here for every 10 millisecond I get a vector for analysis or for I get a parameter vector what kind of parameter I can analyze.
19.srt	00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:10.629	for every 10 millisecond I get a if it is fundamental frequency then also for 10 millisecond I get one pitch parameter.
19.srt	00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:22.929	So, it may contain average of 3 or 4 pitch period inside the 10 millisecond may be 3 or 4 to 5 pitch period is there if it is female voice.
19.srt	00:11:23.319 --> 00:11:29.709	So, now we are framing the speech signal and shifting the window by 10 millisecond.
19.srt	00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:32.509	So, this is the example if this is written here.
19.srt	00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:34.129	So, this is the interval.
19.srt	00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:44.789	1 and then shifting of the frame by 10 millisecond or less 50 percent if it is 20 millisecond window 50 percent overlap means 10 millisecond shifting.
19.srt	00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:55.599	So, I get 100 frame per second I can take 25 millisecond as a window and shifted the frame 10 millisecond that also I get 100 frame per second.
19.srt	00:11:58.159 --> 00:12:04.049	Now, this is the processing part I have discussed.
19.srt	00:12:04.689 --> 00:12:07.089	Now, what What kind of time domain parameters are there?
19.srt	00:12:08.359 --> 00:12:10.729	So, I can say short term energy.
19.srt	00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:17.749	So, for every window I can find out the short term energy of the speech signal.
19.srt	00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:21.899	So, suppose let us application side you can come.
19.srt	00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:36.529	Suppose I have a speech signal there is a voicing, then there is a let us noisy part, then there is a silence part, again there is a voicing part and then again there is a silence part.
19.srt	00:12:38.729 --> 00:12:49.479	Now, suppose some anyhow I want to find out which part is voicing part and which part is unvoiced or silence part, this I want to find out.
19.srt	00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:57.719	So, I want to distinguish between this I want to mark this point, this point and this point that I want to mark.
19.srt	00:13:07.609 --> 00:13:18.989	Now, if in assumption if you say that if I find out the short term energy of the whole speech So, for a let us I take this first this window find out the energy then 50 percent overlap take an window find out the energy E 1 E 2 then take an energy E 3.
19.srt	00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:34.809	So, that way if I find out the energy now if you see since it is a voicing signal the energy will be very high since it is a noisy signal the energy value will be very low if it is a silence energy will be more low.
19.srt	00:13:40.229 --> 00:13:44.749	So, from that short term energy this E value can give me a plot like this that this is may be energy is very high.
19.srt	00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:57.799	So, this is the high high then coming down low then low then again it will go high because of this kind of transition window may take this portion and this portion.
19.srt	00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:59.299	So, it is average out the energy.
19.srt	00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:02.479	So, that is why you get this kind of transitory part also get.
19.srt	00:14:02.699 --> 00:14:09.959	So, from that curve I can find out this up to this point may be the voicing up to this point may be the silence part.
19.srt	00:14:10.299 --> 00:14:11.829	So, that I can easily understand.
19.srt	00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:16.719	So, short term energy is one kind of parameter.
19.srt	00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:26.779	Then short term average magnitude, short time energy or short time average energy or short time average magnitude.
19.srt	00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:30.139	Now, what is the problem in energy?
19.srt	00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:36.349	When I calculate energy, the signal X n has to be square up.
19.srt	00:14:36.939 --> 00:14:41.749	So, every sample value let us if it is a 16 bit speech sample.
19.srt	00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:47.719	So, let us the value is come around 28000 for a one sample.
19.srt	00:14:49.329 --> 00:14:53.379	So, it is 32000 plus and 32000 minus if it is maximum possible.
19.srt	00:14:53.979 --> 00:15:00.370	Now, if it is 28000 if you square it, the number will be integer number will be very high.
19.srt	00:15:01.649 --> 00:15:06.549	So, instead of squaring the signal, what I can do?
19.srt	00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:14.929	I can find out the short term average energy, short term average magnitude energy.
19.srt	00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:17.029	if it is x n is my signal.
19.srt	00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:31.289	So, magnitude is mod of x n is the magnitude and then I can add it take the average take the sum value and divided by the number of sample I get the average magnitude.
19.srt	00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:37.079	So, that I can use as a parameter for this course this instead of E 1.
19.srt	00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:39.869	So, that kind I mathematical details I am coming.
19.srt	00:15:40.289 --> 00:15:47.819	So, that I can use it then short time 0 crossing if you see a let us come in here.
19.srt	00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:56.230	I if you see I do not know whether there is a time signal is there or not I do not have any signal.
19.srt	00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:13.299	Now, if you see any signal any signal if you if you see that this portion lot of time signal is cross the 0 line this portion may be the number of 0.
19.srt	00:16:13.299 --> 00:16:15.289	So, this is a 0 line 0 amplitude line.
19.srt	00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.230	So, 0 line crossing will number within a particular window will compared to this.
19.srt	00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:30.090	So, short time zero crossing can be used to find out whether it is a voice signal or it is a noisy signal.
19.srt	00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.240	So, short term energy is short term zero crossing can be used.
19.srt	00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:42.220	So, the number of zero crossing can be a one parameter to extract the number of zero crossing can be a time domain parameter.
19.srt	00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.720	So, this is time domain parameter I have to extract the for per frame extract the number of zero crossing.
19.srt	00:16:52.980 --> 00:17:06.340	Then short time autocorrelation I come then short time average magnitude difference those are the parameter I can use from the speech signal and those every parameter has its own purpose also.
19.srt	00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:14.870	Now, I just come to that one by one short time energy mathematics.
19.srt	00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:22.860	So, energy E of a signal which is n is equal to minus infinity to infinity x of n.
19.srt	00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.380	square is the energy.
19.srt	00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.000	So, this is the whole signal energy long term definition.
19.srt	00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:51.340	Now, if I take the long term definition let us this is the my signal and if I take the whole energy at a time or this is my signal and I take the whole energy at a time no use, but I do that with that parameter because I want to find out where voice signal, un voice signal, silence.
19.srt	00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.110	So, if I take the whole signal at a time find out the energy.
19.srt	00:17:55.569 --> 00:18:02.670	I get a value which is energy value of that speech signal, but I can I infer any information from that energy value.
19.srt	00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.330	So, there is no use if I use whole signal at a time.
19.srt	00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:19.620	So, what I will do instead of taking whole signal at a time I will multiply the signal this signal e for a particular window.
19.srt	00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:27.210	So, I cut the signal particular window here if I cut the signal I take the signal of particular window.
19.srt	00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:28.519	So, what I am doing it?
19.srt	00:18:29.019 --> 00:18:33.400	So, there is a infinite length signal, I place a window over the signal.
19.srt	00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:56.759	So, this is L equal to 0 to L minus 1 which is W n. So, I can say short time energy in vicinity of n cap n. So, T x is equal to x square value and omega n is equal to 1.
19.srt	00:18:57.059 --> 00:19:07.940	if it is within l equal to less n equal to 0 to l minus 1 ok else it is 0.
19.srt	00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:18.579	So, I cut the signal from the long signal I cut a window and take the energy ok.
19.srt	00:19:30.159 --> 00:19:35.849	So, if I say that find out the short term energy first I record a record your let us record your name in a let us F s is equal to F s is equal to 16 kilohertz and 16 bit mono.
19.srt	00:19:38.309 --> 00:19:40.879	Record your record your name in computer.
19.srt	00:19:41.439 --> 00:19:44.939	So, put the microphone connect to the computer record your name.
19.srt	00:19:45.629 --> 00:19:59.019	Once you let your name consist of 3 second signal or let us 5 second signal long name 5 second signal it is consist of 5 second speech signal.
19.srt	00:20:01.169 --> 00:20:05.859	So, that means 16 kilohertz sample 16 k sample per second.
19.srt	00:20:06.209 --> 00:20:14.199	So, I can get 16 k into 5 80 k sample.
19.srt	00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:19.609	So, I have a 80 k sample this side.
19.srt	00:20:20.429 --> 00:20:23.949	I take a window of 20 millisecond.
19.srt	00:20:25.009 --> 00:20:26.959	So, I take the sample number 0.
19.srt	00:20:27.449 --> 00:20:30.779	So, if it is F s is 16 kilohertz.
19.srt	00:20:31.089 --> 00:20:33.759	then how many sample will be there in 20 millisecond?
19.srt	00:20:34.719 --> 00:20:37.839	In 1 second there will be a 16 k sample.
19.srt	00:20:38.509 --> 00:20:41.199	So, in 1 millisecond 16 sample.
19.srt	00:20:41.629 --> 00:20:46.959	So, 120 millisecond I can get 320 sample.
19.srt	00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:55.069	So, there is a 320 sample in 20 millisecond.
19.srt	00:20:55.509 --> 00:21:04.819	I have a take the first frame 0 to 320 and since I am multiplying a window function with amplitude 1.
19.srt	00:21:05.049 --> 00:21:07.929	So, that means, from take every sample.
19.srt	00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:20.759	So, let us take this is x n. So, I take x 0, then I take some x equal let us k equal to 0 to 320 minus 1.
19.srt	00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:29.039	So, n l is equal to 320 l minus 1 x of k x square of k equal to u 1.
19.srt	00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:36.669	So, first frame power I get, then I shifted this frame.
19.srt	00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:42.889	by 10 millisecond that means, 10 millisecond means 320 divided by 2.
19.srt	00:21:43.129 --> 00:21:46.169	So, that means, 160 sample.
19.srt	00:21:46.769 --> 00:21:51.269	So, I take that another window from 160 sample to here.
19.srt	00:21:54.869 --> 00:21:58.489	So, this is 0 to 319 sample.
19.srt	00:21:58.719 --> 00:22:01.079	So, this is 160 sample to another.
19.srt	00:22:01.409 --> 00:22:05.609	So, here will be 319 plus 160.
19.srt	00:22:05.829 --> 00:22:07.299	So, I get take that sample.
19.srt	00:22:07.699 --> 00:22:09.309	and find out E2.
19.srt	00:22:09.689 --> 00:22:17.679	Then that way I can show if it is 10 millisecond shifting, so I get 100 frame per second.
19.srt	00:22:17.709 --> 00:22:21.149	So, in 5 second I will get 500 frame.
19.srt	00:22:21.389 --> 00:22:27.859	So, I can get E1, E2, E3 dot dot dot dot E500.
19.srt	00:22:29.749 --> 00:22:34.319	So, I get 500 short term energy data point.
19.srt	00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.480	Now, if I told you that this diagram.
19.srt	00:22:42.839 --> 00:22:44.079	So, what is the diagram?
19.srt	00:22:44.619 --> 00:22:51.409	Here is x n, this is f s. If it is energy, then this function is square.
19.srt	00:22:51.700 --> 00:23:05.889	So, if it is short term energy, then I can find out let us this is my signal x n whose sampling frequency is f s. Operator is x of so I can say square.
19.srt	00:23:08.289 --> 00:23:09.730	Where is the operator signal square?
19.srt	00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.009	I take the signal square.
19.srt	00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.669	Then, I pass the signal.
19.srt	00:23:14.199 --> 00:23:38.819	So, all signal is every sample is square rate is still F s. Now, once I pass through the window W n, after the window my rate is F s by R. R is the shifting time.
19.srt	00:23:39.359 --> 00:23:41.319	If it is 10 millisecond, it is 10 millisecond.
19.srt	00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:52.359	So, if it is for every 10 millisecond I get one sample you can say that one data.
19.srt	00:23:52.819 --> 00:24:00.539	So, I can say here I get E n which is nothing but a for every 10 if it is 10 millisecond shifting.
19.srt	00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:11.440	So, 100 frame 100 per second earlier it is F s let us it is 1 F s per F s number of sample per second instead of F s number of sample.
19.srt	00:24:11.829 --> 00:24:14.339	I get 100 number of sample per second.
19.srt	00:24:17.319 --> 00:24:24.289	So, I get E n value E n is equal to 1 2 dot 100 for 1 second.
19.srt	00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:34.129	Here, F s sampling sample 1 2 up to F s F s number of sample or not.
19.srt	00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:40.779	So, this is called I can say that short term energy.
19.srt	00:24:43.779 --> 00:25:15.069	Now, if I instead of energy, I can say that I can replace this box same box by only magnitude again it is F s again if I put a window W n I get F s by R that is M n. So, instead of squaring the signal so M n is nothing but a let us k equal to 0 to L minus 1 that is within the vicinity of the window length you are taking x of M.
19.srt	00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:32.250	let us x of k mod into W n minus k, where n is the here n is the starting window number of window.
19.srt	00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:45.289	So, if it is first window n value equal to 0, if it is second window n value is equal to 160, shifting is 160 sample, if it is third window n value will be starting window of the window n v.
19.srt	00:25:45.989 --> 00:25:51.399	3 20 fourth window starting of the window will be what 3 20 plus 60.
19.srt	00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:52.389	So, I can get.
19.srt	00:25:53.219 --> 00:26:01.619	So, for every window I get 1 m n ok.
19.srt	00:26:02.169 --> 00:26:17.159	So, then I get m n. So, instead of I can get E n I can get m n. E n is the short term energy m n is the average magnitude ok average magnitude.
19.srt	00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:25.419	it is sorry it is a sum of magnitude if I want to make it average 1 by put 1 by L here.
19.srt	00:26:25.829 --> 00:26:29.589	So, I can normalize it also 1 by L L number of sample are there.
19.srt	00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.509	So, I can 1 by L I get the average.
19.srt	00:26:34.139 --> 00:26:35.129	So, average magnitude.
19.srt	00:26:35.369 --> 00:26:37.029	So, using this to see that.
19.srt	00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:47.200	So, this is some plot of of those two parameter you can extract after recording your name extract that n. So, I give you the.
19.srt	00:26:47.559 --> 00:26:48.059	problem.
19.srt	00:26:48.999 --> 00:27:06.279	So, problem is you record your name in 16 bit 16 kilohertz and 16 bit 16 kilohertz and mono record your name using any you can use cool edit you can use path record it.
19.srt	00:27:17.699 --> 00:27:24.119	Then find out E n and M n value of E n and M n E n in the in the in the rate of E n and 100 frame per second and 20 millisecond is the window length.
19.srt	00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:29.999	Take 20 millisecond window length and find out the 100 frames of frame shift is 10 millisecond.
19.srt	00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:34.009	Find out the E n and M n. Then plot the three signal.
19.srt	00:27:34.009 --> 00:27:46.339	One is your first recorded signal, then plot it E n, then plot M n. So, for recorded signal, there are lot of samples will be there.
19.srt	00:27:49.879 --> 00:27:50.709	For E n, for one second I get 10 sample value.
19.srt	00:27:52.539 --> 00:27:56.929	For M n also for 1 second I get 10 sample value.
19.srt	00:27:57.419 --> 00:28:04.489	Now, you see whether you able to find out the voice zone using E n and M n or not.
19.srt	00:28:05.729 --> 00:28:20.139	So, may be if it is voice zone E n value will be high if it is unvoiced or sibilant E n may be if it is noisy unvoiced amplitude may not be that much of fall amplitude may rise somewhere and then again voicing zone it may rise.
19.srt	00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:27.009	Sometime if it is voice bar like this, so I do not know whether it is a voice bar and whether it is a noise.
19.srt	00:28:28.069 --> 00:28:39.569	So for that purpose we use another parameter, but at least using EN I can find out where the speech signal has high energy, where it is there is no energy that I can find out.
19.srt	00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:44.059	So this can be used as a voice detection.
19.srt	00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:49.729	You plot it and see it how it is behave like.
19.srt	00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:53.089	then you can get a real exposure.
19.srt	00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:56.509	Now, another parameter is called zero crossing.
19.srt	00:28:58.449 --> 00:29:11.679	If you see zero crossing yes is an zero crossing if it is a sine wave the sine wave.
19.srt	00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:18.349	So, how many time signal crosses the zero line?
19.srt	00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:25.439	So, it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2 if it is period.
19.srt	00:29:26.079 --> 00:29:31.079	So, if it is I start from 1 then 1, 2 then this point is part of the next period.
19.srt	00:29:31.489 --> 00:29:51.479	So, I can say if it is a pure sine wave then 2 number of zero crossing per cycle per cycles 2 number of zero crossing.
19.srt	00:29:54.409 --> 00:30:08.499	Now, what will happen if you say sometime you may say that I have recorded the signal and this is my 0 line 0 amplitude line by my sine wave in here, which never crosses the 0 line.
19.srt	00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:24.179	That means, there is a 0 line, but the sine wave is dc shifted dc shifted means 0 there is a sine wave.
19.srt	00:30:24.439 --> 00:30:34.049	during the recording there is a DC shift in above that is why 0 line shifted to here 0 line is DC line.
19.srt	00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:45.239	So, if it is DC shifted what I can do either I can pass the signal through a low pass filter or I can take the average and subtract it.
19.srt	00:30:46.649 --> 00:30:54.309	So, first normalize the DC shift of the signal then find out the 0 cosine.
19.srt	00:30:54.819 --> 00:31:01.739	Now, ok just come to the calculation then derive that equation then find out the parameter.
19.srt	00:31:02.109 --> 00:31:10.149	Now, if we see that if it is a pure sine wave two number of 0 crossing per cycle.
19.srt	00:31:10.179 --> 00:31:25.339	Now, if the sampling frequency of this sine wave is F s and the fundamental frequency is F 0 that means, length of the period is 1 by F 0 then I can say.
19.srt	00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:34.149	F s by F 0 number of F s by F 0 sample per cycle.
19.srt	00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:39.189	So, how many sample will be there in per cycle F s by F 0.
19.srt	00:31:40.579 --> 00:31:53.539	So, if it is a 8 kilohertz sampling frequency and I have a 200 hertz F 0, then how many samples will be there in one cycle 8 k divided by 200 hertz.
19.srt	00:31:58.089 --> 00:31:59.209	So, 40 sample.
19.srt	00:32:00.069 --> 00:32:08.769	So, this is number of sample or I can say sample per cycle.
19.srt	00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:16.849	Now, if you see 2 number of 0 crossing per cycle.
19.srt	00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:29.479	So, number of 0 crossing Z 1 is equal to 2 crossing per cycle into cycle pass sample this is.
19.srt	00:32:29.959 --> 00:32:31.240	sample per cycle.
19.srt	00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:51.459	So, cycle per sample is nothing but a F 0 by F s. So, I can say twice F 0 by F s number of zero crossing per sample.
19.srt	00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.910	So, if I want to find out find out the number of zero crossing of 80 sample.
19.srt	00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:29.269	So, let us m sample then Z 1 is nothing but a 2 f 0 by f s into m. So, next class we try to derive the generalized formula how do I find out the zero crossing for non periodic signal or you can say the for speech signal or the periodicity quasi periodic signal.
19.srt	00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.230	So, for there how do I find out or even non-periodic signal, how do I find out the number of 0 crossing.
19.srt	00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.220	Thank you.
7.srt	00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:21.199	So, we are describing the place of articulation.
7.srt	00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.379	So, better if I show you the pictures, let us show you this picture.
7.srt	00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.440	Can you tell me which is the place of articulation?
7.srt	00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.449	It is written.
7.srt	00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.399	If you see, The place of articulation back of the tongue touches the back cavity, this is velar region.
7.srt	00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.509	So velar region it is touches, so it is place of articulation is velar.
7.srt	00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:56.349	Now vocal cords are open, so I can say it is a unvoiced, unvoiced velar, unvoiced velar.
7.srt	00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:58.109	What is the unvoiced velar sound symbol?
7.srt	00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.319	If you see the IPA chart, it is co.
7.srt	00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:11.579	So, there is another variety that can be vocal chord can be closed.
7.srt	00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:18.489	If you see here, place of constriction is same, but during the constriction vocal chord is also closed.
7.srt	00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.890	So, if the vocal chord is closed, then I call it is a voiced part of the valence.
7.srt	00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:29.510	So, it is go.
7.srt	00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:53.609	Now, if you see physically that if a constriction is happen in a tube and back of the tongue there is a air pressure is building up.
7.srt	00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.789	Here the air pressure is building up when the constriction is happen.
7.srt	00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.179	Now, if the air pressure is building up then suddenly it wants to burst.
7.srt	00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.439	So, that is why we call it is a plosive sound.
7.srt	00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.530	Now during that the the the the plosive, so there is a two kinds of movement.
7.srt	00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.159	If you see here articulator has to be released.
7.srt	00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.620	If it is released then a plosive will be happen.
7.srt	00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:39.240	Now if you see any consonant we cannot produce a single consonant alone because during the construction production of the core.
7.srt	00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:46.560	is completely closed, vocal cord is open, so that means no signal is coming out from the mouth.
7.srt	00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.580	Then how do you know it is a co?
7.srt	00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.470	So if you see, we said none of the consonant can be produced single.
7.srt	00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.020	It has to be produced with a vowel.
7.srt	00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.150	So I can say co-m-a-ca, I can say produce.
7.srt	00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.800	Think about the production sequence.
7.srt	00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:23.300	If I want to produce the ka during the ko, the back of the tongue touches the velar position and it is totally closed, cavity is totally closed.
7.srt	00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:33.620	Then suddenly it has to be burst to open, when the cavity will be, the constriction will be open, then there will be a burst sound and it will release.
7.srt	00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.090	So if I see the sound plane, I will show you in the wave diagram also, acoustic signal.
7.srt	00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.030	it is silence, no signal.
7.srt	00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.360	Suddenly there will be a burst.
7.srt	00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.190	Then the burst is happened.
7.srt	00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.180	So this vocal, the tube constriction is released.
7.srt	00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.000	But I have to produce a.
7.srt	00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.320	So there is a requirement, the vocal cord has to be closed.
7.srt	00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.780	To production of a, I require vocal cord has to be closed.
7.srt	00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.870	So if I want to close the vocal cords.
7.srt	00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:23.379	So, there is a synchronization problem between the articulator close and release and vocal chord close and release.
7.srt	00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.360	So, there will be a time gap.
7.srt	00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.060	So, if I say state diagram, let us here vocal chord articulator is closed.
7.srt	00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.629	So, velar portion is closed means articulator is closed.
7.srt	00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.170	So, articulator is closed, no signal.
7.srt	00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.430	Let us this is the articulator open position, this is closed position, this is articulator.
7.srt	00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.320	Now, this is vocal cords or glottis.
7.srt	00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.710	This is closed position, this is open position and this is closed position, closed this is vocal cord.
7.srt	00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:10.520	Now, articulator is closed during the production of co, I want to produce ca.
7.srt	00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.570	So, during the co period, articulator is closed.
7.srt	00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.740	Then suddenly, it is want to open.
7.srt	00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.380	So the opening is not drastically fall out.
7.srt	00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.970	So it is open and then it has to be produced vowel a tongue has to move to produce the vowel a.
7.srt	00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.340	So let us the articulator is closed in here like this way.
7.srt	00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:48.780	So let us this is this is the not approximate like this this point articulator is completely open this point.
7.srt	00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.070	Now vocal chord is vocal chord is open during the production of the co.
7.srt	00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.550	So this period vocal chord is open.
7.srt	00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:07.330	Now once it want to produce a it has to be closed vocal chord has to be closed.
7.srt	00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:19.640	So vocal chord let us vocal chord close in here want to close in here and then start closing in here.
7.srt	00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.690	and then complete a will be produced in here.
7.srt	00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.460	Let complete a position tongue move in here.
7.srt	00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:37.450	So if I see this point burst is occur, this silence then burst is occur.
7.srt	00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.150	Then articulately is not completely open and it is not exactly a.
7.srt	00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.350	So there will be a although the vocal cord is also not open vocal cord is open here not close.
7.srt	00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.100	So vocal cord is closed here.
7.srt	00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.910	So, vibration is start from here.
7.srt	00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:00.250	So, let this vibration is start and here I reach the vowel a. I can show you one picture.
7.srt	00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.140	Let us come here.
7.srt	00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:13.630	If you see this picture, so during the production the articulator is closed, no sound, vocal cords is open.
7.srt	00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.770	Articulator is closed, vocal cord is open.
7.srt	00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.740	So, this period we call occlusion.
7.srt	00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:38.080	Now articulator is suddenly released, there is a burst is occur, but articulator released and sudden sound is come and articulator try to move to position of the produce the vowel a.
7.srt	00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.610	Now if you see, same time glottis may not be closed.
7.srt	00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.710	So, there is no voice sound.
7.srt	00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:54.590	So, there is a voice gradual gap between the articulator close, articulator open and vocal cord close.
7.srt	00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.720	So, there is a settling time.
7.srt	00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:06.050	That is called voiced on set time, V O T voiced on set time.
7.srt	00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:13.460	So, then there will be a transitory part of the vowel, then the steady state vowel will be reached.
7.srt	00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:32.970	So, here if you see totally unvoiced, totally nothing, no signal is there occlusion, then there is a burst, then there is a gap between the articulator opening and vocal cord closing.
7.srt	00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:37.889	So, there is called VOT, voice onset time.
7.srt	00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:48.850	During this period, vocal cord may produce an aspiration sound, then it is called aspirated sound.
7.srt	00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.039	If it is aspiration is not there, we call unaspirated VOT.
7.srt	00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:57.019	So, this VOT is called VOT.
7.srt	00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:04.370	V o t might be aspirated or may be unaspirated.
7.srt	00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:21.639	So, depending on the whether it is aspirated or unaspirated, we can say we have a four varieties of velar sound ka, then kha, then gha and gha.
7.srt	00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:28.299	So, upper H, this H is aspiration.
7.srt	00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:31.919	symbol for aspiration as per the IPA notation.
7.srt	00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:35.899	If aspiration is voiced, then we call voiced aspiration.
7.srt	00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:40.659	If the aspiration is unvoiced, then we call unvoiced aspiration.
7.srt	00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:50.939	So, I have a velar sound, four varieties, ka, aspiration, kha, ga and gha.
7.srt	00:09:50.939 --> 00:09:56.230	All are plosive or stop plosive.
7.srt	00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:04.309	is velar, kha is velar, gha is velar, gha is velar.
7.srt	00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:08.209	Only difference is the manner of articulation.
7.srt	00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:13.449	If I say kha is unvoiced, unaspirated.
7.srt	00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:23.079	During the production of the kha, the back of the tongue touches the velar position, but vocal cord is open.
7.srt	00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:26.189	So, there is no voicing during the occlusion.
7.srt	00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:29.389	That is why it is called unvoiced.
7.srt	00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:40.000	Since VOT does not carry any aspiration, then it is called unaspirated sound.
7.srt	00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.919	So, unvoiced unaspirated velar plosive.
7.srt	00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:55.179	This is the explanation of co, we write this way to put two slash line to produce to identify the different sound.
7.srt	00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.340	This is the symbol for writing the also, any consonant or consonant.
7.srt	00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.840	any IPA notation sound.
7.srt	00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:08.960	So, if it is co, once I write co, then and there I know what its property.
7.srt	00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:10.370	What is the property?
7.srt	00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.930	It is a unvoiced, unaspirated, velar plosive.
7.srt	00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:18.879	Is it okay?
7.srt	00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:22.870	Unvoiced, unaspirated, velar plosive.
7.srt	00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:49.600	So, if I start from this language, mainly in Indian language, If I give the example, if you see if it is a vocal cords is look like this, if you see that this is my upper cavity and this is my lower cavity, this is my lower cavity and this is velum.
7.srt	00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:38.379	If it is upper cavity, upper cavity bilabial, dental, alveolar, post alveolar, palatal, Now, if I come from this side, let us say, palatal, postalveolar, alveolar, then dental, bilabial, labial, depending on that way, if you see in most of the Bengali language, Bengali, Hindi, Most of the Indian language, they will have ka, ka, ka, ga, ga.
7.srt	00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:48.169	So we start from here, they will have some, they will have consonants, ka, ka, ga, ga.
7.srt	00:12:48.840 --> 00:13:02.679	So difference is unvoiced, unaspirated, unvoiced, aspirated, voiced, unaspirated, voiced, aspirated, ka, ka, ga, ga.
7.srt	00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:03.990	Listen.
7.srt	00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:05.629	There is a nozzle stop.
7.srt	00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:11.250	So that is velar nozzle.
7.srt	00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.740	If that nozzle is produced, that we call velar nozzle.
7.srt	00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:21.240	So then there will be nozzle sound which is velar nozzle.
7.srt	00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.810	I just pervert the symbol of the velar nozzle.
7.srt	00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:28.240	I can go to the IPA chart and find out the symbols for the velar nozzle.
7.srt	00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:35.700	If I say the velar nozzle, it will look like not callback.
7.srt	00:13:36.159 --> 00:13:38.649	It will be velar nazar not curl back.
7.srt	00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:41.029	It will be look like this.
7.srt	00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.740	This is velar nazar.
7.srt	00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:45.840	So velar nazar.
7.srt	00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:57.429	Then after the velar, we have forget about the ch, I will, affricates I will come later on.
7.srt	00:13:57.429 --> 00:13:59.590	That is ch, ch, j, j will come later on.
7.srt	00:13:59.669 --> 00:14:00.789	So then we have a ta.
7.srt	00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:05.230	Rectoflex is the most alveolar to palatal region is the rectoflex.
7.srt	00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:12.329	So tip of the tongue back and touches the upper cavity that is called retroflex sound.
7.srt	00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:25.299	If I come to the animation, this is the retroflex sound and retroflex also have toh, toh, doh, doh.
7.srt	00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:27.809	What is there?
7.srt	00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:36.169	This is the retroflex sound.
7.srt	00:14:36.849 --> 00:14:37.209	And .
7.srt	00:14:37.609 --> 00:14:48.229	writing ta is to but it is called this bottom up is a call back that is a symbol of recto flex symbol of recto flex.
7.srt	00:14:49.439 --> 00:15:07.789	So it is nothing but a ta unvoiced unaspirated recto flex unvoiced aspirated recto flex voiced unaspirated recto flex voiced aspirated recto flex ta ta da ta.
7.srt	00:15:10.719 --> 00:15:13.559	So depending on the place and manner.
7.srt	00:15:13.849 --> 00:15:18.059	I am writing the symbol okay.
7.srt	00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:32.249	Then if it is retroflex, retroflex no, I can write retroflex no in here which is nothing but a n but call back retroflex no.
7.srt	00:15:33.429 --> 00:15:41.569	Then after retroflex, we have a dental sound ta ta da da.
7.srt	00:15:41.809 --> 00:15:44.969	So, we have a ta ta.
7.srt	00:15:46.219 --> 00:16:00.859	Bengali, Hindi, all Indian language, unvoiced, unaspirated, unvoiced, aspirated, voiced, unaspirated, voiced, aspirated.
7.srt	00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:07.239	This is velar, this is retroflex, this is dental or alveolar.
7.srt	00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:52.049	Then we have a pa pa bo po unvoiced unaspirated unvoiced aspirated unvoiced unaspirated unvoiced aspirated bilabial labial ok so this is the stop consonant if you see in Bengali language or Hindi language All stop consonants are exist and all have four varieties.
7.srt	00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:57.919	In the most of the Indian languages, there are four varieties 1, 2, 3, 4.
7.srt	00:16:58.299 --> 00:17:05.999	Again, there is a 1, 2, 3, 4 in rectoflex, 1, 2, 3, 4 in dental region, 1, 2, 3, 4 in labial region.
7.srt	00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.559	Then there is another sound in Indian language.
7.srt	00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:13.959	If you see that is called affricate.
7.srt	00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:18.489	It is what is affricate sound you can say.
7.srt	00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:26.839	If you see this one, affricate sound means it is a combination of two sounds.
7.srt	00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:44.419	When I produce chur, if you see that when I producing chur, then tip of the tongue touches the dental region and glide back to velar region to produce the friction sound.
7.srt	00:17:49.329 --> 00:18:03.309	The tip of the tongue touches the dental region to produce the flushing part and after the flushing tongue is curled, the tongue is pushed back and touches the post alveolar region to produce the friction.
7.srt	00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:08.990	Then we can write the symbol tau is the flushing part.
7.srt	00:18:09.259 --> 00:18:16.930	So it is written by T and this saw is the friction part which is written by the post alveolar saw.
7.srt	00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:20.680	So I can write post alveolar or palatal saw.
7.srt	00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:22.289	I do not know what is the saw.
7.srt	00:18:23.139 --> 00:18:28.269	This saw is palatal or post alveolar, post alveolar saw.
7.srt	00:18:29.649 --> 00:18:41.069	So if it is, if it is unvoiced friction, then I can write F, this kind of, not F, there is no cut, this one.
7.srt	00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:49.700	So it is a flotion plus friction, two kinds of sounds are there, that is why it is written in two symbols.
7.srt	00:18:51.459 --> 00:18:52.629	and friction part.
7.srt	00:18:52.919 --> 00:18:55.259	This is voice friction, this is the voice flushing.
7.srt	00:18:57.599 --> 00:19:07.419	Similarly, this cha after the friction, there may be a VOT which is aspirated or unaspirated.
7.srt	00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:16.500	So, I can write either this symbol which is cha and cha and this symbol is ja.
7.srt	00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:23.529	If it is aspiration, it is ja.
7.srt	00:19:24.189 --> 00:19:26.959	all the consonant can be described.
7.srt	00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:36.989	It can be consist of two symbols or it can consist of single symbol and with diacritics marks which explain whether the aspiration is present or not.
7.srt	00:19:37.359 --> 00:19:45.699	This aspiration, if this H has two varieties, if it is simple H then it is called unvoiced aspiration.
7.srt	00:19:45.979 --> 00:19:50.759	If it is a voiced aspiration then I have to use the symbol of voice applicative.
7.srt	00:19:54.859 --> 00:19:55.149	Okay.
7.srt	00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:58.639	So, that all are described in here.
7.srt	00:19:59.009 --> 00:20:01.109	Now I will show you some picture.
7.srt	00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:25.569	So, somebody if I give me this picture and told me which sound probably this is, I can say this is nothing but a voiced stop, voiced bilabial stop.
7.srt	00:20:25.889 --> 00:20:42.229	So, if it is a biased bilabial stop, that means either it can have a bow or it can have a bow, that it can be have a aspirated biased bilabial stop or it can have a unaspirated biased bilabial stop.
7.srt	00:20:42.509 --> 00:20:57.679	Now, if I see the picture after recording, if I see the spectrogram and the picture, if you see this is Kho, you see here this is Kho, then VOT is aspirated and VOT is longer.
7.srt	00:20:58.149 --> 00:21:01.129	all aspirated consonant V o t is longer.
7.srt	00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:06.859	So, occlusion, burst, aspirated.
7.srt	00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:11.889	If it is voiced, during the occlusion period, vocal cord is closed.
7.srt	00:21:12.189 --> 00:21:14.789	So, there is a voiced burr kind of sound.
7.srt	00:21:15.089 --> 00:21:17.619	That is why it is called voiced.
7.srt	00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:19.839	So, occlusion is voiced.
7.srt	00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:24.409	So, it is voiced top, go.
7.srt	00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:28.219	Then, if it is gha, then there will be expiration.
7.srt	00:21:28.819 --> 00:21:32.399	V ot, all other same then it is gha.
7.srt	00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:42.529	Similarly, if I say applicate occlusion part unvoiced then friction then V ot.
7.srt	00:21:42.849 --> 00:21:49.139	So, if it is occlusion in unvoiced friction is present V ot is unaspirated then it is cha.
7.srt	00:21:50.489 --> 00:21:53.609	If it is V ot is aspirated then it is cha.
7.srt	00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:58.519	If it is occlusion is if this portion is voiced.
7.srt	00:21:59.999 --> 00:22:05.049	I can say this is voiced so it is jaw jaw.
7.srt	00:22:05.309 --> 00:22:11.699	So, I can show you after the next class that I opened a spectrogram and I classify which kind of sound it is.
7.srt	00:22:12.329 --> 00:22:15.419	If it is a fricative thus look like this.
7.srt	00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:22.249	If it is a vowel then it will be a periodic sound okay.
7.srt	00:22:22.769 --> 00:22:24.009	It is a periodic sound.
7.srt	00:22:24.439 --> 00:22:26.649	So, this is a different Bengali vowel shape.
7.srt	00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:29.169	You can cut see the other vowel shape also.
7.srt	00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:36.379	Then, I can show you there is a phonetic chart for English language and Bengali language.
7.srt	00:22:36.379 --> 00:22:42.639	You can see that there is a phoneme in English and phoneme in Bengali.
7.srt	00:22:42.969 --> 00:22:47.299	So, all the phonemes I have tabulized in English, all the phonemes in Bengali.
7.srt	00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:54.439	So, there is a thesis also we have studied that similarity between the American English and Bengali English.
7.srt	00:22:54.769 --> 00:22:58.859	So, there we have taken those things and find out the similarity, non similarity.
7.srt	00:22:59.119 --> 00:22:59.959	All those things.
7.srt	00:23:00.499 --> 00:23:22.679	But here if you see the two phonemic chart, in English if you see we have only English plosive has only p t k b d g, but in Indian language let us Bengali it has ka ta ta pa, so 4 into 4 into 4 into 4, okay.
7.srt	00:23:23.009 --> 00:23:34.869	But we have only 7 vowels in Bengali, but here if you see there are lot of vowels in English, how many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15.
7.srt	00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:52.449	Then if I say we have applicate, applicate, bias, unbiased, applicative, then nasal, lateral, trill and flap, there is a nasal, applicate, applicative, lateral, approximate all kinds of sounds are there.
7.srt	00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:56.439	So, there is a similar sound, dissimilar sound all those things are there.
7.srt	00:23:56.749 --> 00:24:05.059	So, you can go through that, but how to write that once I know the symbols I can describe the place and manner of articulation.
7.srt	00:24:07.229 --> 00:24:07.529	plasim.
7.srt	00:24:07.639 --> 00:24:17.509	So, this is the sound description and this is how the place and manner of articulation are described in acoustics phonetics.
7.srt	00:24:17.699 --> 00:24:33.749	So then instead of vowel and consonant there may be other sound also like that approximate or this is the vowel vowel combination, semi vowel or glides, dipthong, hiatus all kinds of sounds will be there.
7.srt	00:24:33.749 --> 00:24:35.959	As an engineer we should know.
7.srt	00:24:36.379 --> 00:24:50.029	What is the difference signal wise difference between a semi vowel and glide hiatus and diphthong that we should know not that what is the definition of hiatus what is the definition of diphthong there may be linguistic definition all those things.
7.srt	00:24:50.289 --> 00:25:01.499	But as an engineer I should know if there is a diphthong and if there is a semi vowel somebody is going so what is the difference between because I have to recognize it from the signal.
7.srt	00:25:02.089 --> 00:25:03.639	So, what is the signal look like this.
7.srt	00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:06.529	So, I will show you the signal for Bengali example Bengali.
7.srt	00:25:07.469 --> 00:25:08.619	There is another important thing.
7.srt	00:25:10.069 --> 00:25:16.769	I said that vowel or F1 F2 plane all the cardinal, this is called cardinal diagram.
7.srt	00:25:17.089 --> 00:25:19.399	So, cardinal vowel diagram it is called.
7.srt	00:25:19.629 --> 00:25:20.879	Vowel can be placed.
7.srt	00:25:21.149 --> 00:25:24.939	If I place the Bengali vowel, it will look like this.
7.srt	00:25:25.929 --> 00:25:28.319	Back and front is F2.
7.srt	00:25:28.719 --> 00:25:31.139	Height is defined by F1.
7.srt	00:25:31.139 --> 00:25:33.769	Close or open is defined by F1.
7.srt	00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:35.509	So, it is F1 and F2 plane.
7.srt	00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:38.359	So, I can see that different vowels.
7.srt	00:25:38.719 --> 00:25:50.449	depending on their production mechanism, tongue position and tongue height, they are described and that can be mapped in the F 1 and F 2 plane.
7.srt	00:25:50.889 --> 00:25:54.490	So, when I describe the engineering model, I use this thing.
7.srt	00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.169	So, if I say I want to classify, let us I give an example.
7.srt	00:25:58.609 --> 00:26:07.699	If I say I want to classify between O and E, if the distance is much, one is front vowel, one is back vowel.
7.srt	00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:13.579	So, in that case, F2 value one is very low and another is very high.
7.srt	00:26:14.599 --> 00:26:17.929	So, F2 value will be different, F1 value will be different.
7.srt	00:26:18.199 --> 00:26:28.299	So, depending on the F1, F2 value, so I can place the vowel and I can immediately understand which vowels can be classified in better accuracy from which.
7.srt	00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:51.109	So, that cardinal vowel diagram or if I say plot the cardinal vowel diagram of English, you can construct the F1, F2 vowel F1, F2 of different sample and then plot it in F 1 F 2 plane and find out the where it is cluster, where is who is there, what do you mean by central vowel, how it is changing.
7.srt	00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:53.949	So, all kind of cluster position you can analyze.
7.srt	00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:55.789	So, that is also important.
7.srt	00:26:56.549 --> 00:27:02.379	Now, if I say the diphthong hiatus, I am not going through the slides because you can read this slide.
7.srt	00:27:02.379 --> 00:27:04.089	This is the linguistic definition.
7.srt	00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:07.439	There is some example I have given from the Bengali.
7.srt	00:27:07.809 --> 00:27:10.209	If you want, I can give you the English example also.
7.srt	00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:12.219	The English example also is there.
7.srt	00:27:12.349 --> 00:27:14.329	So, if you see the signal.
7.srt	00:27:14.839 --> 00:27:21.459	This red line, green line, blue line and yellow line are the formant line, formant movement line.
7.srt	00:27:21.899 --> 00:27:33.759	If you see that the movement of the formant is different for different vowel after vowel combination and that produce a hiatus, diphthong all kinds of things will be there.
7.srt	00:27:35.649 --> 00:27:37.699	This is the phonetic chart for Bengali.
7.srt	00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:39.909	I have prepared it for that things.
7.srt	00:27:40.679 --> 00:27:44.969	Then next class what I will discuss.
7.srt	00:27:45.489 --> 00:28:04.379	I will open a speech signal in this spectrogram and time domain speech signal, then try to find out what kind of signal it is, whether it is a tau, whether it is a dou, whether it is a dou, whether it is a pau, whether it is a va, we want to classify it.
7.srt	00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:05.079	So, thank you.
6.srt	00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:17.710	ok so let us start ah that ah last class we have discussed about that engineering models of the speech production systems we said that this vocal tube can be model as a filters and glottis vibration can be model as a source so we said the source filter model we said let this is a filter that is h let us h s and there is a source called e s or i can say e n and h n in digital system and the output is the speech either s s or small s n ok so now if i say that this is a filter ok So, if the source is exist, so all voice sound the source is modified by the filter and source has only property the fundamental frequency contour and it is nothing but a impulse.
6.srt	00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.120	So, if you say here in the slides, so it is nothing but a impulse.
6.srt	00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:38.810	So, excitation generation nothing but a impulse and that excitation is coming through a filter which is model as a linear filter why we consider linear filter and how this model is mathematically describe we will discuss later.
6.srt	00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:46.469	So, this is nothing but a linear filter and convolution of e n and h n produce speech.
6.srt	00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.800	So, in time domain if it is convolution frequency domain it is nothing but a multiplication.
6.srt	00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.600	So, now how do I classify the voice sound?
6.srt	00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.540	So, voice sound is classified based on two properties.
6.srt	00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.890	One is the fundamental frequency of the excitation which is constant throughout the all voice sound.
6.srt	00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:13.339	Now, different model of filter can produce different voice sound.
6.srt	00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:29.979	So if I say as you know H is nothing but H is a filter model that is nothing but a some P by Q as you know in any model is nothing but a pole and 0 kind combination of pole and 0.
6.srt	00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:35.769	So root of this thing is provide me 0 and root of this thing is provide me the poles.
6.srt	00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:41.529	So now you know as per that control systems if you have that background of electronics.
6.srt	00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:49.900	that all pole related to the formant frequency or resonance frequency later on resonance frequency.
6.srt	00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.740	So, at for every pole there is a resonance frequency.
6.srt	00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.209	So, if Q s is a first order system first order then it is a only single pole.
6.srt	00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.639	So, I can the single resonance frequency if it is a multi order systems nth order say n number of resonance frequency will be there.
6.srt	00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.509	So, if I see if I look at the frequency response of this linear system it will be look like this.
6.srt	00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.099	If you see look like this, so every peak is called formant.
6.srt	00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.900	So all voice sound are characterized by those formants.
6.srt	00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.519	So this is first formant, second formant, third formant and fourth formant so on the formant will be there.
6.srt	00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:41.449	So if it is frequency domain, if this axis is frequency and this axis is the amplitude of that frequency and omega is the analog frequency, it is a so in analog frequency then it is nothing but a multiplication.
6.srt	00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.949	So this frequency response of the unit impulse will be modified by the filter frequency response.
6.srt	00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:56.459	Details of how what should be the formant structures will come on when we model this speech production system.
6.srt	00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:07.999	So, all the voice sounds are characterized by the formant frequency for different voice sound has different kind of formant frequency that is why they sound like different sound.
6.srt	00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:16.750	So, then if just this we have already explained that why that woman has shorter f 0 and formant frequency.
6.srt	00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:18.969	then I have go to this directly.
6.srt	00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.589	So, there is some average F0 value.
6.srt	00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:30.609	If you see the average F0 value for man is F0 average 150 hertz and minima is 80 and maxima is 200.
6.srt	00:04:30.609 --> 00:04:39.969	If you see the woman it is average is 225 almost above 200 hertz and children it is above 300 hertz kind of mean frequency.
6.srt	00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:54.509	So, if you that you have experience that if you see if you know the singing, so bass frequency that somebody has B sharp, B flat, B flat, B flat, B flat, those kind of scale you are using that is nothing but a match with your average f 0 frequency.
6.srt	00:04:54.829 --> 00:05:06.919	Now, formant frequency also I will come on what should be the human minimum formant frequency and all those variation I will come on when we discuss about the uniform tube modeling of the speech production system.
6.srt	00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:14.159	So, any voice sound I can say that it is characterized by the formant frequency or resonant frequency.
6.srt	00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.869	So, formant frequency is nothing but the resonant frequency.
6.srt	00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.620	So, if I say any voice sound vocalic sound if this is frequency and this is amplitude it will be look like this.
6.srt	00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.819	So, this is first formant f 1, this is f 2, this is f 3, so on f 4, so on going on.
6.srt	00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:39.549	Once it is going up the amplitude will be going down that will discuss why this is going down.
6.srt	00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:44.239	Now if the voice sound is characterized with the why the formant frequency.
6.srt	00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:50.539	So, formant frequency depends on the structure of the this vocal track.
6.srt	00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:54.250	How this formant frequency will change depending on the h s.
6.srt	00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:59.599	So, H s will be modified based on the structure of the whole tube.
6.srt	00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:07.079	So, different structure can produce the different kind of voice sound and this has the different kind of formant frequency.
6.srt	00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:17.279	Now, if I related to the vowel sound, if I related to the sound which is unvoiced sound we can say that there is a difference between the unvoiced and silence.
6.srt	00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:21.599	So, aspiration, friction are called unvoiced sound.
6.srt	00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.569	Unvoiced means vocal chord is not vibrate but still there is a noise kind of sound.
6.srt	00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:29.729	The source is aspiration and friction.
6.srt	00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.509	How the aspiration is produced?
6.srt	00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:37.389	Suppose you have a tube, you create a narrow constriction in the tube.
6.srt	00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:38.719	Now what will happen?
6.srt	00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:44.459	The air pressure lungs produce an air pressure and you create a narrow constriction constriction using the tongue.
6.srt	00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:45.589	Then what will happen?
6.srt	00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:52.229	The force air try to find out a path and there is a friction kind of noise sound will be generated.
6.srt	00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:56.669	So those kind of sound is called aspiration and friction sound will be generated.
6.srt	00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:01.939	So, details will come in that manner of articulation and that place of articulation discussion.
6.srt	00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:03.319	the place of articulation.
6.srt	00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:07.669	For example, suppose I want to produce the vowel ah.
6.srt	00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:14.669	So, I can see the vocal cords is vibrating and hip of the tongue is raised ah.
6.srt	00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:22.099	So, the place where the obstruction is happened is called place of articulation.
6.srt	00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:27.359	And manner, manner means how I produce that sound.
6.srt	00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:32.569	That means when I produce the sound, I produce the sound.
6.srt	00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:40.269	whether the air is fully flow, whether the air flow is tucked, whether the air flow is passes through a narrow cavity.
6.srt	00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:46.729	So, all kind of air flow mechanism are produced the manner of articulation.
6.srt	00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:52.759	Now, you can see the manner of articulation has also two major difference.
6.srt	00:07:52.759 --> 00:08:01.729	One is called either this vocal if I say the source is also part of manner of articulation, then either source can present or source can absent.
6.srt	00:08:02.049 --> 00:08:03.749	So, either glottis can vibrate.
6.srt	00:08:03.989 --> 00:08:05.149	or glottis can absent.
6.srt	00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:07.870	So glottis has two manners.
6.srt	00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:12.560	When the glottis is closed then the voice sound is produced.
6.srt	00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.089	When it is totally open then the unvoiced sound is produced.
6.srt	00:08:17.219 --> 00:08:21.569	So anything can be voiced or unvoiced.
6.srt	00:08:22.219 --> 00:08:33.409	So two part based on the glottis it has two part either it can be voiced or it can be unvoiced.
6.srt	00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.549	place of articulation has produced different sound.
6.srt	00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:40.639	How do I describe the place?
6.srt	00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:55.289	So, different place are if you see the bilabial, labiodental, dental, alveolar, postalveolar, retroflex, palatal, velar, uvalar, pharyngeal and glottal.
6.srt	00:08:55.759 --> 00:09:09.329	So, if I see the upper track of the human speech production system which is there in here, if you see the different upper cavity can be part in different place.
6.srt	00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:19.509	by labial, then dental, then can be labiodental means lip and dental can be there or I can draw that.
6.srt	00:09:20.129 --> 00:09:22.439	This will be very easy if I draw it.
6.srt	00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:26.100	Let us say draw a human speech production system.
6.srt	00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:30.100	I do not find that duster.
6.srt	00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:35.860	So, if I see it that schematic diagram of the human speech production system, I want to draw it.
6.srt	00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:46.689	So, if I see, let us I start from labiodent then it can goes to the teeth, teeth, palatal and then goes velum.
6.srt	00:09:46.689 --> 00:09:52.899	So, there will be a velum cavity in velum then.
6.srt	00:09:52.899 --> 00:10:05.039	So, lower cavity is bilabial teeth and then tip of the tongue and then come in the voice.
6.srt	00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.309	So, here either gotis clan close or open.
6.srt	00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.509	If it is close then I call voice sound.
6.srt	00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.430	if it is open then i call unvoiced sound now when if the tip of the tongue touches the teeth then i call it is a dental sound or blockage can be happened in here constriction can be happen in labial position also so this is called labial lips dental then you can say the alveo post alveolar alveolar alveolar post alveolar velar so all kind of place i can show you in different schematic diagram all kind of place for different kind of sound production systems.
6.srt	00:10:48.850 --> 00:11:01.180	Now, depending on the place, the sounds are classified in different labial, bilabial, when the sound are produced two lips.
6.srt	00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:09.889	Labiodental, when the sound are produced by a constriction of a lower lips with upper tip, upper teeth.
6.srt	00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:14.529	Dental, when the sound is produced by the constriction of tip.
6.srt	00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.659	of the blade of the tongue with the upper teeth.
6.srt	00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:34.810	Ta, ta, pa labial, bilabial, pa, bilabial two lips are close together to produce the pa, bilabial then ta if you see the tip of the tongue touches the dental position so it is ta dental.
6.srt	00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:46.379	Then alveolar the sound made by tip or the blade of the tongue within the contract against the alveolar region, alveolar region after the teeth the alveolar region.
6.srt	00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:48.679	Then we call say alveolar sound.
6.srt	00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:51.100	Then after alveolar there is a post alveolar.
6.srt	00:11:51.740 --> 00:12:06.889	Then after post alveolar retroflex sometime it is not a place of articulation it kind of manner of articulation when the tip of the tongue curl back and touches the upper cavity in post alveolar region we call retroflex sound.
6.srt	00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:17.309	So tip of the tongue curl back ta ta that is why it is called retroflex sound.
6.srt	00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:18.250	sound.
6.srt	00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:31.519	Similarly, if I say there is a palatal sound, when the constriction made in the front part of the tongue with the hard palate, hard palate means middle of the cavity, hard palatal region.
6.srt	00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:35.309	When the palatal region is come, then it is called palatal sound.
6.srt	00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:37.809	Then after the palatal, there is a mellar sound.
6.srt	00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:43.419	When the back of the, now you see that, after here tongue cannot go back.
6.srt	00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:45.740	So, the back of the tongue can also move.
6.srt	00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.709	When the back of the tongue raise.
6.srt	00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:53.179	and touches the velar position to produce the sound, we call velar sound.
6.srt	00:12:54.039 --> 00:13:02.939	If it is a , then back of the tongue is raised and touches the velar position, then we call velar sound.
6.srt	00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:06.289	Similarly, uvelar, pharyngeal and glottal sound.
6.srt	00:13:06.289 --> 00:13:11.019	When the sounds are coming from the glottal lesion, we call glottal sound.
6.srt	00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:17.939	So depending on the place of the constriction, sounds are described and that description is called .
6.srt	00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:20.009	place of articulation.
6.srt	00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:31.879	Because the constriction is made different position, so tube structure will be different, different kind of frequency will be produced by the tube and that is why the sound is different.
6.srt	00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:46.470	Now if I go to the manner of articulation, as I described the manner of articulation depending on the source, glottis has two manner, either it is voiced or unvoiced or aspiration is there.
6.srt	00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.120	So, voiced, unvoiced, aspiration and aspiration may be there.
6.srt	00:13:50.479 --> 00:13:52.959	So, these three are the source.
6.srt	00:13:53.659 --> 00:14:07.109	And there is another manner of articulation which is called plosive or stop, nozzle stop, fricative nozzle stops or plosive, fricative, lateral, approximate, till, trill, flap or tap.
6.srt	00:14:07.849 --> 00:14:09.620	What do you mean by the plosive sound?
6.srt	00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:19.439	Now, if you see, if from the tip of the tongue close the upper cavity, if I say paw.
6.srt	00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.639	Let us two lifts are closed together, paw.
6.srt	00:14:23.909 --> 00:14:24.639	What is happening?
6.srt	00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:49.269	In the back cavity, the after before the closure, so if the closure is here, then the sound, the air pressure in here is building up because the cavity is closed, paw and suddenly this is released and some burst is coming out, sound burst is coming out, paw.
6.srt	00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.279	That is why, it is called plosion or plosive, plosion.
6.srt	00:14:55.099 --> 00:15:01.009	So, if the consonant sound is followed by a vowel, then what is happening?
6.srt	00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:12.949	Now, back of the cavity sound pressure increases, it creates a plosion that is why it is called plosive.
6.srt	00:15:13.469 --> 00:15:19.979	Sometime suppose if I say ok, ok or ok, then what is happening?
6.srt	00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:30.749	there is a vowel sound is producing by the vocal track and suddenly it want to produce a consonant you want to produce a constriction.
6.srt	00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:35.029	So, it is want to stop then it is called stop sound.
6.srt	00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:42.979	So, plosives or stops it can be either plosive consonant or it can be a stop consonant.
6.srt	00:15:43.169 --> 00:15:46.729	So, if it is a followed by a vowel then it is a plosive will be happen.
6.srt	00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:52.519	If it is after vowel there is a sound ka then it called.
6.srt	00:15:52.889 --> 00:15:55.869	this ko is stop it is not plosive.
6.srt	00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:59.429	So, this is plosive and stop.
6.srt	00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:08.929	Then nozzle stop sometime if you say na ma bilabial nozzle ma ma.
6.srt	00:16:09.299 --> 00:16:13.729	So, if the velum is open that is why it is called nozzle cavity is attached.
6.srt	00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:14.999	So, this is nozzle sound.
6.srt	00:16:15.669 --> 00:16:22.699	Then there is a fricative affricate lateral approximate fricative if you say shh.
6.srt	00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:24.889	So, it is fricative sound.
6.srt	00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:27.499	Applicate sound has two properties.
6.srt	00:16:28.249 --> 00:16:33.369	Applicate first part is flotion, second part is friction.
6.srt	00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:35.279	That is why it is called applicate sound.
6.srt	00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:37.969	I will show you an animation for that.
6.srt	00:16:38.319 --> 00:16:43.499	Applicate means first part is flotion, second part is friction.
6.srt	00:16:43.709 --> 00:16:45.569	That is why it is called applicate sound.
6.srt	00:16:45.969 --> 00:16:53.569	Then lateral sound, if you see the tip of the tongue touches the upper cavity and sound is coming the two side of the tongue.
6.srt	00:16:54.019 --> 00:17:09.119	So, side of the two side are open and the sound is or air is coming out from the two side of the tongue then it is called bilateral sound.
6.srt	00:17:09.259 --> 00:17:14.019	If it is single side it is coming unilateral sound.
6.srt	00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:15.199	So, it is lateral sound.
6.srt	00:17:16.259 --> 00:17:21.689	Then approximate like that we have Bengali has two approximates.
6.srt	00:17:21.689 --> 00:17:24.059	Approximates are look like a vowel.
6.srt	00:17:56.059 --> 00:17:58.970	yaw and if I say hawawaw and approximate or glide you can say then trill rrr rrr so tip of the tongue touches the upper cavity and it vibrate trill rrr rrr if you say tip of the tongue touches the upper cavity and it vibrate rrr rrr so it is trill then tap or clap even back tip of the tongue back of the tip of the tongue touches the upper cavity like a flap, then it is called flap or tap.
6.srt	00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:08.650	So, back of the tongue touches the upper cavity and produce that sound that is why it is called tap or flap.
6.srt	00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:11.910	Now, I go to the details discussion on that.
6.srt	00:18:12.329 --> 00:18:18.160	Then if you see sound can be classified two things one is called oral vowel and nasal vowel.
6.srt	00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.250	Vowel sound is described in term of tongue movement I will come later on.
6.srt	00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.869	Then diphthong semi vowel.
6.srt	00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.840	and consonant.
6.srt	00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.870	So those of you who can go through the slides, those of you who know you can go through that.
6.srt	00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:38.320	If you see how the sound is unique, it does not require the language.
6.srt	00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:45.410	If I say ka for Hindi, ka for Bengali, ka for English, all is ka, sound ka.
6.srt	00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:51.160	How the sound sequence is produced, then the language rule is come out.
6.srt	00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:57.750	So if I want to describe the each and individual sound which is produced by the human being.
6.srt	00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.640	and try to find out a symbol for each individual sound.
6.srt	00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:12.670	So depending on the place and manner of articulation, what I do, I try to find out or try to assign a symbol to each particular sound.
6.srt	00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:25.270	So what I want, depending on the place and manner of articulation, I try to assign a symbol to each and every sound.
6.srt	00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.380	So maybe some language has some group of sound.
6.srt	00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.060	Some language may not have some group of sound, so that is okay.
6.srt	00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:38.540	But those sounds which exist in the language may be exist in other language also, so that is exist.
6.srt	00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:56.750	So, sound which is distinct sound which is produced by different constriction and different kind of mechanism by the human vocal track has to be assigned a particular symbol that is called IPA, International Phonetic Alphabet.
6.srt	00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.720	So, that is why it is called IPA.
6.srt	00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.610	phonetic alphabet.
6.srt	00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:10.590	I can assign a symbol to each an individual sound, depending on the place and manner of articulation.
6.srt	00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.460	Now, sound has a consonant.
6.srt	00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:13.580	I already discussed.
6.srt	00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:18.600	We have a consonant, we have a vowel, we have a diphthong, we have an approximate.
6.srt	00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.410	Those all have to be assigned some symbol.
6.srt	00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:28.180	So, depending on the place and manner of articulation, we assign those symbols.
6.srt	00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.980	This chart, there is another call.
6.srt	00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:41.210	If you see the consonant which is written palmonic, it can be palmonic.
6.srt	00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.100	I think non-palmonic also I have symbol.
6.srt	00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:57.300	So, most of the cases, the sound which is produced during the air, air flow is from lungs to mouth is called palmonic sound.
6.srt	00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:10.000	During the production of the sound, if the air flow in this direction, then the it is from lungs to mouth, then we call this is a pulmonic sound.
6.srt	00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.799	Non-pulmonic, if the air flow is reverse, then we call it is a non-pulmonic sound.
6.srt	00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:25.609	So, any pulmonic consonant, in that case the air is coming from lungs to mouth.
6.srt	00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:28.670	So, that is the pulmonic sound.
6.srt	00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:33.619	So, pulmonic sound depending on the place and manner of articulation.
6.srt	00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.779	they have assigned different symbols.
6.srt	00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:45.200	If you see this side is the place of articulation and this side is the manner of articulation.
6.srt	00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:56.029	If you see the chart, this row wise is the place of articulation, column wise is the manner of articulation.
6.srt	00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.299	Now, if you see plosive or stop.
6.srt	00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.630	So, if you see the plosive or stop bilabial plosive.
6.srt	00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:18.159	So, if I want to produce a bilabial process, plosive that means I can draw it or I can go to here.
6.srt	00:22:19.169 --> 00:22:22.240	So, you can get that animation.
6.srt	00:22:22.529 --> 00:22:23.279	Let us like this.
6.srt	00:22:23.769 --> 00:22:24.879	Let us go to this picture.
6.srt	00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:34.669	So, if I want to produce a bilabial sound, bilabial sound is here, yes, bilabial sound, I want to produce a bilabial sound.
6.srt	00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:36.169	What is that?
6.srt	00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:38.720	then I call voiced sound.
6.srt	00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:49.740	So any bilabial plosive has two varieties, two manner of articulation depending on the source vocal cords.
6.srt	00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:54.150	Either it can be voiced or it can be unvoiced.
6.srt	00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:01.960	So if you see the chart, it is written P for unvoiced, B for next one is for voiced.
6.srt	00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.650	So there are two places, unvoiced and voiced.
6.srt	00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:15.230	Similarly, if you see or , voiced, unvoiced, voiced, unvoiced, voiced, unvoiced.
6.srt	00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:22.670	So may be some language does not have this sound, but other language may have this sound.
6.srt	00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:35.259	So if you see that consonant symbols in the IPA chart, depending on the voiced, unvoiced symbols are different and depending on the manner, if you see the different symbol.
6.srt	00:23:35.569 --> 00:23:37.160	Bilabial nasal is manner M.
6.srt	00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:42.090	Bilevial trill if it is able to produce this is capital B.
6.srt	00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:49.069	Similarly, we have produced bilabial trill R, it is on the alveolar position.
6.srt	00:23:49.529 --> 00:24:03.069	Then tap or flap, fricative if I say I will produce dental saw saw saw, but we may produce palatal saw saw or post alveolar saw, with palatal or post alveolar saw saw saw.
6.srt	00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.549	Lateral fricative approximate, lateral approximate.
6.srt	00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.370	If it is see that.
6.srt	00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:14.670	only voiced part unvoiced part is not there that is why it is a single symbol if you see single symbol.
6.srt	00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:27.870	So, depending on the voice that is voiced or unvoiced two sound and depending on the manner in here different sounds are there we will describe later on we will describe details.
6.srt	00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:39.610	Similarly, non-polymonic I am not discussing non-polymonic and there is a other kind of symbols are there if you see the IPA chart downloaded from IPA site there are other kind of symbols are also there.
6.srt	00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.220	Now, I go for the vowels.
6.srt	00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.750	If you see the vowel, how the vowel sound is specified?
6.srt	00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:53.830	In case of production of the vowel, the constriction is not take place.
6.srt	00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.510	The constriction is not there.
6.srt	00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.100	What is there?
6.srt	00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.210	The tongue movement.
6.srt	00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:04.600	If you see, tongue can move front and back.
6.srt	00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.230	If you see, your tongue can move either back or front.
6.srt	00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.080	Back of the tongue can raise.
6.srt	00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:15.390	or front of tongue can come out front and front of the tongue can raise.
6.srt	00:25:16.059 --> 00:25:30.430	So, depending on the tongue, tongue front and backward movement and tongue height that means how the tongue is moving your upper palate is fixed, lower palate is moving tongue is moving.
6.srt	00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:37.150	So, tongue height and tongue movement frontness and backness and tongue height.
6.srt	00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.069	So, depending on the front or back where the vowel is produced.
6.srt	00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.700	and depending on the tongue height all the vowels are described.
6.srt	00:25:47.570 --> 00:26:09.510	So, tongue height means if it is high, if tongue is raised high then it is close, almost close that is why it is also called close, tongue closer or if it is low, tongue height is low then it is also called open vowel.
6.srt	00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.920	Sometime you find some literature has closed or high, open or low.
6.srt	00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:26.610	And depending on the tongue height and tongue forwardness, different symbols are there for different vowel sound.
6.srt	00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:35.310	So, vowels are classified or vowels are symbolized based on their vowel position, production position.
6.srt	00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:42.640	Instead of constriction, here we call vowel, depending on the articulatory position, vowels are described.
6.srt	00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.300	Either it can be high, low or high.
6.srt	00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.420	low or it can be front and back.
6.srt	00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.430	And there is another thing also.
6.srt	00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:59.800	It is not considered but there is there that if you see some vowels are required lip movement also.
6.srt	00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:05.990	If you either say you can say the lip rounding, it is called lip rounding.
6.srt	00:27:06.019 --> 00:27:10.360	Sometimes we round the lip and sometimes we do not round the lips.
6.srt	00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.500	Here I am showing you the picture for different vowel production.
6.srt	00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.280	If you see.
6.srt	00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.069	lip are rounded.
6.srt	00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:24.019	So, lip rounding and the tongue position are described the vowel sound.
6.srt	00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.000	I am not playing the vowel.
6.srt	00:27:26.329 --> 00:27:27.799	There is a different kind of vowel sound.
6.srt	00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:30.059	You can, if it is shared, you can play the sound.
6.srt	00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:38.220	Now, as an engineer, we do not know what is the vowel tongue height, tongue kind of things, how do you describe.
6.srt	00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:46.049	So, can I find out some parameter which will be related to the tongue height and which is related to the tongue.
6.srt	00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.200	forwardness and backwardness.
6.srt	00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.110	Yes, it is possible.
6.srt	00:27:50.529 --> 00:28:05.690	If you see the formant, vowels are described based on the formants and the formants it is F 1 is nearly 500 hertz, F 2 is 1.5 kilohertz, F 3 is 2.5 kilohertz, I will come how it is 500 hertz like that.
6.srt	00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:17.980	Now, there is a relation here depending on the tongue height is related to the first format.
6.srt	00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:29.720	Tongue front and backness is related to the second format and lip rounding is related to the third format.
6.srt	00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:46.930	So, depending on seeing the, so this is a correlation, there is a close relation between the F 1 and tongue height and it is correlation between the F 2 and tongue lowerness, the tongue movement in the front and back.
6.srt	00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.280	So, this is front and back.
6.srt	00:28:50.020 --> 00:29:00.780	So, either I can see the F1 and F2, I can classify whether this is a high vowel or low vowel.
6.srt	00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:05.000	I can classify whether it is a front vowel and back vowel.
6.srt	00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:15.790	So, the same place, same articulatory place can be simulated or can be modeled or can be placed in a formant measurement plate.
6.srt	00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:54.710	So, I can back that I can find out the frequency and I can plot them f 1 and f 2 plane will generally call f 1 and f 2 plane where the vowel sounds are classified so now if I say f 1 and f 2 are classified the vowel sound different kind of vowel sound so I can say the vowel if I the content or whether I said r or o it depends on f 1 and f 2 and f 3 some part of f 3 whether leap rounding is required or not that is f 3.
6.srt	00:29:55.210 --> 00:30:02.809	So, f 1, f 2 and f 3 is describing the vowel which vowel it is.
6.srt	00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.009	So, you can say the content.
6.srt	00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:13.250	Now, if you say the formant frequency f 1 and f 2 describing the vowel different vowels then why we require the higher formants?
6.srt	00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:17.460	Higher formants may be communicate.
6.srt	00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:23.000	the speaker style or other information also.
6.srt	00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:31.100	So, F1 and F2 are mainly responsible for which vowel I have produced.
6.srt	00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:43.580	If I change the F1 and F2, the sound may be A becomes O or U becomes O if I change the vowel, if I change the format.
6.srt	00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:52.060	So, F1 and F2 describe the vowel quality or you can say the vowel which vowel I have produced.
6.srt	00:30:52.990 --> 00:31:09.580	And f 1 and f 2 related to the tongue height and tongue backness or front and back is f 2 and tongue height and whether it is close or open or low or high that depends on the f 1 and f 3 is the lip rounding.
6.srt	00:31:10.009 --> 00:31:15.789	So, next class I will take take away to that animation and find out that different place of articulation.
6.srt	00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:16.700	Thank you.
4.srt	00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:22.530	So, we are discussing about that LTI systems and their implementation.
4.srt	00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.350	Now, come to the sequence representation of the discrete signals and LTI systems.
4.srt	00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:57.189	Suppose, I have an LTI system in here ok LTI system which is H n H H n let us ok. Now, I want to provide a input and I get an output Y n if I provide a input X n ok. Now, I want to know frequency response of this H n ok.
4.srt	00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.289	So, mathematically I can do many things, but so what is Y n?
4.srt	00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:29.700	y n is nothing but a h n convolved with x of n which is nothing but a k equal to minus infinity to infinity h k into x of n minus k ok x of n minus k is ok or not ok. Now let us consider I want to find out the frequency response.
4.srt	00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:34.689	So, if I excite the systems with an individual frequency.
4.srt	00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.599	then I change the omega for 2 hertz, then I change the omega for 3 hertz.
4.srt	00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.739	So, I can do that way and n is the number of sample.
4.srt	00:01:45.079 --> 00:02:03.959	So, I apply a e to the power j omega n what should be the output then y n is nothing but a k equal to minus infinity to infinity h k let us h k into x of n minus k is replaced by e to the power j omega.
4.srt	00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.870	So, e to the power j omega.
4.srt	00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.110	n minus k ok.
4.srt	00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:32.159	So, which is nothing but a k equal to minus infinity to infinity h k e to the power minus j omega k into e to the power j omega n ok.
4.srt	00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.270	So, if I write down e to the power j omega n.
4.srt	00:02:36.520 --> 00:03:00.160	is nothing but a k equal to because this is not depend on the k. So, e to the power j omega n outside minus infinity I can write down h k into e to the power minus j omega k. So, what is e to the power minus j omega k?
4.srt	00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.850	What is e to the power h k?
4.srt	00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.930	So, I can say that y n.
4.srt	00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:34.530	is nothing, but a e to the power j omega n at where k equal to minus infinity to infinity h k into e to the power minus j omega k. So, this term is nothing, but a frequency response of the systems frequency response of the systems.
4.srt	00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:53.449	So, I can write down this this term frequency as a e to the power j omega n H of capital H frequency frequency plane e to the power j omega frequency response of that LTI system.
4.srt	00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.930	So, if you see e to the power j omega is the frequency response of the said LTI systems ok. Now, I can say If I see this equation, if you see this equation what is there?
4.srt	00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.330	This is a complex number.
4.srt	00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.480	So, there has a magnitude and there has a phase.
4.srt	00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.500	So, I can say h e to the power j omega has an complex.
4.srt	00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:36.769	So, it has an phase or you can say the magnitude which is nothing but a h e to the power j omega mod and e to the power j phi omega is the phase.
4.srt	00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.629	So, I can say h is a real part and imaginary part.
4.srt	00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.219	again this is complex number property.
4.srt	00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:21.779	So, cos omega j sin omega k. So, I can write real part is nothing but a cos part and imaginary part is nothing but a sin part minus h k sin omega k. So, magnitude response is nothing but a complex number real square plus imaginary square phase is nothing but a tan inverse or arc tan tan inverse imaginary by real part and delay function is nothing but a tau omega is equal to d phi omega by d omega.
4.srt	00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:27.709	Those things will be used frequently in signal processing of speech signal processing.
4.srt	00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:39.619	Then I am not going this property you can find out the phase component is nothing but a odd function and the response is nothing but a even function.
4.srt	00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:43.069	So, this is the LTI systems signals.
4.srt	00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:44.349	Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:51.740	Here the time domain signal is discrete, but frequency domain it is continuous.
4.srt	00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.120	Time domain signal is discrete, but frequency domain it is continuous.
4.srt	00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:11.300	So, discrete time Fourier transform time domain it is discrete, but here discrete Fourier transform input is discrete and frequency domain also it is represented as a discrete.
4.srt	00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:16.159	So, this is a DTFT and DFT.
4.srt	00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:36.060	So, DFT X n is in DTFT X n is digital, but whatever I get X omega is continuous, but here X n is also digital and X omega is also digital.
4.srt	00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:44.949	Sometimes we write it X k discrete frequency instead of omega.
4.srt	00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:48.209	So, what is the concept behind this?
4.srt	00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:52.079	I am not going this one, this DFT I will as I am describing the DFT.
4.srt	00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:56.929	So, what I will do discrete Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:02.569	So, discrete time first you just know the equation of discrete time Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:16.889	So, I can say x of omega where the frequency is continuous is nothing, but a n equal to minus infinity to infinity x n.
4.srt	00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:39.429	e to the power minus j omega n. Now, I said that frequency domain it also discrete that is called DFT discrete time and discrete Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:43.599	So, it is not discrete time Fourier transform it is discrete Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:48.659	So, this omega is replaced by k, k is the discrete Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:07:48.939 --> 00:08:08.659	So, n equal to then becomes 0 to n minus 1 x of n e to the power j omega n k. Why it is you say it is minus infinity to plus infinity it is 0 to n minus 1 why?
4.srt	00:08:21.679 --> 00:08:24.339	I said discrete frequency the frequency axis also discrete and if I say that the frequency that means, I am sampling the frequency scale also.
4.srt	00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:40.329	So, suppose I have a frequency range this one here to here is f I want to discretized it ok.
4.srt	00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:49.969	So, I am saying let us divided this length with a n number of discrete value ok.
4.srt	00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.669	So, I divided this n.
4.srt	00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:53.369	n number of discrete value?
4.srt	00:08:53.659 --> 00:09:04.479	If it is n number of finite length discrete value, I can say then it is a the period is after n, I am saying the signal is repeating itself.
4.srt	00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:19.439	So, x k is a period of n, capital N, the number of sample I have taken, I have the number of discrete sample, the discrete sample I have made the frequency response.
4.srt	00:09:19.439 --> 00:09:21.769	So, this is the, if you explain it like this way.
4.srt	00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:29.309	So, this is continuous frequency I discretize it with a number of discrete value.
4.srt	00:09:54.279 --> 00:10:01.779	So, if it is discrete DFT then equation is x k is equal to n equal to 0 to n minus 1 x n e to be power j omega n k. So, if it is that then this n is called DFT length of the DFT length of the Now, suppose I have a signal with sampling frequency fs is 8 kilohertz.
4.srt	00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.029	Sampling frequency is 8 kilohertz.
4.srt	00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.259	Now, I said I take n is equal to let us 1000.
4.srt	00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:22.690	I divided whole frequency range is the 8 kilohertz frequency range.
4.srt	00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.070	I divided in.
4.srt	00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.889	1000 number of pieces equal amount of pieces.
4.srt	00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:30.420	So, I can say each pieces.
4.srt	00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:39.940	So, k is varies from 0 to 1000 0 1 2 3 4 6 4 5 6 8 up to 1000.
4.srt	00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:55.019	So, I can say that whole 8 kilohertz space is divided in 1000 pieces that means every sample k value k equal to 0 k equal to 1 means it is separated by 800 hertz.
4.srt	00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:06.519	So, the value distance between the two k value is 8 hertz this is called frequency resolution.
4.srt	00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:22.080	So, frequency resolution is nothing but a F s by n. So, suppose I want to find out the what is the frequency analog frequency value at k equal to 10.
4.srt	00:11:23.409 --> 00:11:26.629	So, it is nothing but a into k is equal to F s.
4.srt	00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:37.780	So, at k equal to 10 in this case F s is 8 kilohertz 8 into 1000 divided by 1000 into 10.
4.srt	00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.010	So, 80 hertz.
4.srt	00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:52.510	So, if my signal is contained 80 hertz component then the power at here will be come here.
4.srt	00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:58.590	So, once I want to draw the draw a DFT suppose I done a DFT.
4.srt	00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:07.610	So, I can say DFT once I done the DFT I have a x k ok.
4.srt	00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:27.820	So, x k is nothing but a n equal to 0 to n minus 1 where n is the DFT length x of n input signal e to the power minus j omega n k ok. Now, x k is a complex signal x k is a complex signal.
4.srt	00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.840	So, a complex signal has an amplitude and has an phase.
4.srt	00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:45.310	So, I can write this signal is nothing but a cos and sin a plus j b a plus j b.
4.srt	00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:04.100	So, if it is a plus j b then I can say x k has an magnitude response which is defined like so discrete signal is third bracket always represented by a third bracket slide may be it is first bracket, but discrete signal is always depend on a third bracket.
4.srt	00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:14.659	So, mod of x k is nothing but a root over of a square plus b square that is called magnitude response.
4.srt	00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:17.110	So, what is the phase response?
4.srt	00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:27.029	Theta is nothing but a or arg of theta arg of x k x k theta is nothing but a tan inverse b by a.
4.srt	00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.800	Now, suppose I told you I have a signal x n.
4.srt	00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:39.199	find out the magnitude frequency response frequency magnitude response.
4.srt	00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:42.289	So, find out the magnitude frequency response of x.
4.srt	00:13:42.379 --> 00:13:51.829	So, I have to plot the mod of x k. So, after computing DFT I get a plus j b from.
4.srt	00:13:52.299 --> 00:14:03.220	So, I compute the a square plus b square root over that is the amplitude if it is voltage then it is has to be square to make it power if it is power then it is root over of a square plus b square.
4.srt	00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:05.939	So, now if I want to drop draw it.
4.srt	00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:19.409	this axis is k and this axis is the power mod of x k. So, k is nothing but a k is varies from 0 to n minus 1.
4.srt	00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:36.399	Now, I told you I do not want the discrete frequency k, can you make it with the axis of f instead of k can I replace this axis by f very easy because f is equal to nothing but a.
4.srt	00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:49.019	If this signal is sample, this x n is sample is 8 kilohertz and my n is equal to 1000, then I can say 8 k divided by 1000 into k, I get the corresponding frequency.
4.srt	00:14:49.920 --> 00:15:02.000	So, instead of 0, I can write 0, this will be let us frequency f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4 for different k value, I get the analog frequency value.
4.srt	00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:14.720	Now, if you see here f is equal to 0, so x 0, is nothing but a frequency is equal to 0 that is nothing but a d c component of the signal.
4.srt	00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.280	So, x 0 is the d c component of the signal.
4.srt	00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:37.980	So, those property you have to know frequency resolution d c component how do you make the k to f conversion those things will be used in implementation of digital this digital speech processing ok. Now, there is another property I have not described this one again.
4.srt	00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.840	So, the symmetry property is there.
4.srt	00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:52.240	So, if I say DFT is called symmetry, after DFT xk is symmetry, sk is obey the symmetry property.
4.srt	00:15:54.730 --> 00:16:12.760	That means, if I draw it here xk, let us this is my k axis k. So, at here n minus 1, it is nothing but a F s. At k equal to n minus 1, it is nothing but a F s.
4.srt	00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.020	So, F s by 2 is my signal limitation.
4.srt	00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:25.870	So, I can say it repeat the property this is the F s by 2 point or n by 2 point.
4.srt	00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:38.090	So, 0 to n by n by 2 minus 1 give me the same this information and this information will be same information for baseband signal.
4.srt	00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.830	So, after analyze the frequency if I use 1000 point DFT 500 point.
4.srt	00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.620	property will be repeated in here in mirror in nature.
4.srt	00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:54.440	So, I can take this one only to find out the frequency response of the signal.
4.srt	00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:12.000	Then DFT magnitude when a real input signal contain a sine wave component a peak amplitude a 0 the integer number of cycle n then cycle over input sample then it is nothing but a m r equal to a 0 into.
4.srt	00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.950	So, amplitude of the signal will be magnified by n by 2 if it is real valued signal.
4.srt	00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.970	If it is a complex signal, it will be n number of.
4.srt	00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:29.940	So, when you do the inverse DFT, I should normalize the amplitude by if it is if it is real input signal.
4.srt	00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.130	So, it is n by 2.
4.srt	00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:40.440	If it is a complex input signal, then it will be n. And there is a DFT leakage.
4.srt	00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:43.110	All those things you can find in that DSP book.
4.srt	00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.320	DSP leakage means.
4.srt	00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.800	There is two kind of things if you see.
4.srt	00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:56.390	Suppose I have sampled a signal in 8 kilohertz and of a signal let the signal has 50 hertz.
4.srt	00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:04.640	So, 50 hertz signal sinusoidal signal has sampled at 8 kilohertz.
4.srt	00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:12.600	So, if I take the 1000 n equal to 1000 sample then the frequency resolution is 8 hertz.
4.srt	00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.540	So, for every k.
4.srt	00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:31.640	I will get 0, then 8 hertz, then 16 hertz, then 24 hertz, then let dot dot dot dot, then you have 48 hertz and then next one is 56 hertz.
4.srt	00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.860	So, my resolution does not support the 50 hertz.
4.srt	00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.820	So, the power, but the signal has only power at 50 hertz.
4.srt	00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:48.450	So, if I make the DFT, so instead of looking like 50 hertz single spike.
4.srt	00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:56.630	it will be look like this power will be distributed at adjacent computation point.
4.srt	00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.670	So, this will be look like this.
4.srt	00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.080	So, this is the DSP computational leakage.
4.srt	00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:09.930	Then there will be another another effect windowing effect also will be come I will discuss later on when we design the filter.
4.srt	00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:20.270	Now, you know that implementation of DFT is a discrete Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:26.440	is done based on fast Fourier transform algorithm.
4.srt	00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:34.420	So, FFT is not the transform, FFT is an algorithm to implement DFT.
4.srt	00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:41.840	So, that is why it is called fast Fourier transform algorithm, fast Fourier transform FFT.
4.srt	00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.990	So, FFT is an implementation procedure for DFT.
4.srt	00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:54.170	So, if I say the DFT is nothing but a x of k.
4.srt	00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:15.720	is nothing but a sum of n equal to 0 to n minus 1 x of n into e to the power minus j omega n k. So, how many number of complex multiplication is in here n cross n n cross n complex multiplication is there.
4.srt	00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:23.140	Now, I want to reduce it I want to reduce this complex multiplication.
4.srt	00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.260	So, that it can compute very faster.
4.srt	00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.440	So, how do you can do it?
4.srt	00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.650	That is why it is called fast Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:44.200	So, instead of n cross n, can I use some other method which can be computationally reduce which can reduce the computational cost of the DFT.
4.srt	00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.120	One method is called fast Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.730	I will discuss only Radix II algorithm, other you can study from the DSP book.
4.srt	00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:57.860	So, Radix II algorithm is most commonly used algorithm.
4.srt	00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:28.460	So, if I say I want to reduce the n cross n, I ask you the from the computations background that suppose I have a search space, if I make it binary search then it is log 2 n. So, that means if I instead of computing using the whole signal if I disseminate or if I if I somewhere I can disseminating the signal in some you can small chunk.
4.srt	00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.120	and then if I compute, is it help us?
4.srt	00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.680	Yes.
4.srt	00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:59.360	So, what they done FFT, Radix 2 algorithm that if I take the length of the DFT is we can say that if the n can be represented by 2 to the power something, the length of the DFT restriction is that I want to discrete, I want to divide the whole signal in binary space, you know 2 spaces, 2 part.
4.srt	00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:10.420	then 4 part, 5 part like that itself like the binary search whole number divided middle first part, second part and then I will do the first part, then I will do the second part like that way I want to do it.
4.srt	00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:18.820	So, what I want that length of the DST must be expressed by this way 2 to the power something.
4.srt	00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:24.500	So, I cannot take n equal to 1000 because it cannot be expressed in 2 to the power something way.
4.srt	00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:30.940	So, if I take n is equal to 1024 then I can say it is nothing, but a 2 to the power 10.
4.srt	00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.240	So, this is the restriction Redix 2 algorithm that is why it is called Redix 2 algorithm.
4.srt	00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:57.020	Then whole signal x n either can be broken in time domain or I can use whole x n and broke the computational output based on which frequency domain output in small number of chunk.
4.srt	00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:06.100	So, either x n can be divide or I can divide x k also, two space I can divide the signal.
4.srt	00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.789	So, let us start with the disseminating time time algorithm.
4.srt	00:23:12.259 --> 00:23:24.069	So, here what I do instead of computing whole DFT at a time, I divide the input signal in two term one is even term another is odd term.
4.srt	00:23:26.059 --> 00:23:31.340	Then again this one is divided even and odd and even and odd until and unless.
4.srt	00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:40.460	I reach 2 point where I cannot divide 1 even and 1 odd.
4.srt	00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:51.590	So, this algorithm is described in a book you can do that I just explain you by a let us take the 8 point DFT 8 point DFT n equal to 8.
4.srt	00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.950	So, that means, it can be expressed 2 to the power 3.
4.srt	00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.170	So, 3 stage I can divide it.
4.srt	00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:21.030	So, first stage let us the signal is x 0, x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4, x 5, x 6, x 7 and x 7.
4.srt	00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:24.840	So, 8 number of signal I have taken n equal to 8.
4.srt	00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.910	I divide this signal space in two space, one is odd and even.
4.srt	00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.000	Let us even.
4.srt	00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:43.410	So, 0 2 4 6 1 3 5 7.
4.srt	00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:50.520	So, I can say let us start the signal instead of taking the signal 1 2 3 6.
4.srt	00:24:50.910 --> 00:25:00.620	So, I take the upper part let us 0 2 4 6 and then I take 1 3 5 7.
4.srt	00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.100	Then again this can be divided into two part.
4.srt	00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:13.380	even 0 4 and odd 2 6 again it is even 1 5 odd 3 5.
4.srt	00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:24.540	So, once I get two signal I compute the DFT this is called butterfly algorithm I will not details discuss the mathematics of butterfly algorithm.
4.srt	00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:43.540	Now, if you see I get the output x 0 x 1 x x 3, x 4, x 5, x 6, x 7.
4.srt	00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:52.320	Now, you may say how do I divide the signal in odd and even if it is my signal size is 1024.
4.srt	00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:05.350	There is a trick if you know that the just that trick I will discuss that is called bit reversible a technique.
4.srt	00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:11.680	I require 3 bit this is equal to 3, 3 bit I require.
4.srt	00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.440	So, I can see the 3 bit I can generate 7 number.
4.srt	00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:24.090	Now, to do this odd and even distribution what I do that access the signal in bit reversible format.
4.srt	00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:33.650	When you access the signal the index term reverse the bit, if it is 10 bit reverse the bit.
4.srt	00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.440	So, what I will do I reverse the bit.
4.srt	00:26:36.710 --> 00:27:06.500	So, instead of 000, I write 000 because reversible and non-reversible same, 001 I write 100, 010 I write 010 same, 011 110, 100 001, 101 101, 110 001 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 if you see 0426.
4.srt	00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:18.380	1, 5, 3, 3 and sorry 1, 5, 3, 7.
4.srt	00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:29.230	So, this arrangement is done automatically if I just access the signal, the index of the signal is change in bit reversible mode.
4.srt	00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:34.570	So, if it is n equal to let us 1024.
4.srt	00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.960	So, I require 10 bit to represent the index.
4.srt	00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:22.779	when i access the signal i will change the bit reverse i get it and then i do the calculation whatever is required for butterfly algorithm so that i have explained in dft i am not explaining details because this can be explained details in dsp class you know it now i come to the application side so once i done the where i use the dft or frequency transform in speech If you see, suppose I have a time domain signal, I have already showed you time domain signal and this is the, this portion I have selected, this portion of the signal I have selected and take the frequency response of the signal.
4.srt	00:28:25.589 --> 00:28:37.409	Now, there is a point, if I take n is equal to 1024 point, 1024 that means, order of the DFT is 1024.
4.srt	00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.769	So, I take the signal 1024 sample signal.
4.srt	00:28:42.839 --> 00:28:48.519	So, if I suppose I have a long signal which is stationary signal.
4.srt	00:28:48.859 --> 00:28:57.769	So, whether I take this portion or I take this portion or I take this portion, this portion, this portion or this portion, the signal property is remain same.
4.srt	00:28:58.049 --> 00:28:59.799	In that case, I do not have any problem.
4.srt	00:29:01.569 --> 00:29:04.499	Now, suppose the signal time is also changing.
4.srt	00:29:04.779 --> 00:29:06.819	Along the time signal property is changing.
4.srt	00:29:08.349 --> 00:29:13.219	So, if I say, if I take this portion of the signal 1024.
4.srt	00:29:14.009 --> 00:29:27.109	So, whatever the frequency response I will get frequency response I will get that is the average frequency response of whole signal means I am considering during this time the signal does not change its property.
4.srt	00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:46.470	So, what I am losing I am losing the time domain resolution of the signal time domain resolution I am losing ok. Now, if I want to increase the time domain resolution what I will do.
4.srt	00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:51.609	instead of n equal to 1024 let us I take n is equal to 256.
4.srt	00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.200	Then my time domain resolution is increases because I my window size is very less.
4.srt	00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.650	So, I can get the better time resolution.
4.srt	00:30:04.579 --> 00:30:17.369	Now what is happen since f is equal to frequency resolution is nothing but a f s by n if n is decreasing the frequency resolution is also decreasing.
4.srt	00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:25.720	So, once I increase the time domain resolution, my frequency domain resolution is decreasing.
4.srt	00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:34.009	So, if I take long signal, I time domain resolution is losing.
4.srt	00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.330	If I take small signal, frequency resolution is losing.
4.srt	00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.500	So, this is the limitation of Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:48.759	That is why people are use more number of other number of transform like wavelet, EMD all kind of things is used.
4.srt	00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.930	So, let us forget about that things.
4.srt	00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:09.890	Suppose I told you record a voice or I can say record a signal and design an algorithm or design and compute or draw its frequency response or spectrum of the signal.
4.srt	00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.110	I am not saying spectrogram.
4.srt	00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:17.190	So, amplitude response representation is called spectrum.
4.srt	00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.160	So, what is that?
4.srt	00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.769	It is nothing but a spectrum.
4.srt	00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:33.290	mod of x k versus frequency that drawing is called spectrum of the signal.
4.srt	00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:50.160	So, if I told you record the vowel r and take the n equal to 1024 point and draw the spectrum of the vowel r. So, I will draw the frequency response of the vowel r.
4.srt	00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:59.760	f. That means, if I can draw it with respect to k and I can convert the k with respect to f, then I get the frequency response of the signal.
4.srt	00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.800	So, this can be draw in linear view or log view.
4.srt	00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.960	Log view means if you see there is a two kind of view, log view and windowing I will come later on.
4.srt	00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:15.910	So, log view and linear view.
4.srt	00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.020	So, there will be a log view.
4.srt	00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.660	I can take the output as a log.
4.srt	00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.640	So, log spectrum or normal spectrum.
4.srt	00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.070	spectrum this is the normal spectrum.
4.srt	00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.230	So, then once I get the spectrum I get the formant frequency plot.
4.srt	00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:35.050	So, that means I know the formant frequency representation of the signal and details I will come STFT when we discuss.
4.srt	00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:43.700	Now this is called spectrum now when you draw this kind of representation this is called spectrogram.
4.srt	00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:52.670	So, difference is that spectrum is frequency versus power means the power of each frequency plot.
4.srt	00:32:53.360 --> 00:33:03.390	Spectrogram, x axis is the time, y axis is the frequency and power is converted into the intensity or color.
4.srt	00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.250	So, it is a 3D curve.
4.srt	00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.670	The representation is that if you see there is a long line, same line is coming.
4.srt	00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:12.730	Why this line is coming?
4.srt	00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.760	So, what I do?
4.srt	00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:22.650	So, I want this axis is time, this axis is frequency and intensity.
4.srt	00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.100	as an amplitude.
4.srt	00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.410	So, I have a long signal.
4.srt	00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:33.820	So, I take the small chunk of the signal from here and find out this point.
4.srt	00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.050	Then, I plot it here.
4.srt	00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:45.850	So, for this whole chunk, frequency presentation will be same.
4.srt	00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.700	Next chunk I will take and then I plot it here.
4.srt	00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:08.010	So, if it is 10 millisecond window, then this 10 millisecond will be same this 10 millisecond will be same that is why you see this kind of things are coming ok.
4.srt	00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:14.860	So, this is called spectrogram and earlier one is called spectrum ok.
4.srt	00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:21.520	So, next is the digital filter this is the last portion of the DSP view.
4.srt	00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:29.360	So, digital filter if you say any forget about the filter any transfer function let us I have a.
4.srt	00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.350	is nothing but a polynomial function.
4.srt	00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:42.040	So, solution of P z provide me with a 0 position and solution of Q z provide me the pole position.
4.srt	00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:53.780	That is why H z is a pole 0 filter pole and 0 filter that is why H z has a formant and 0 provide the anti-formant or resonance anti-resonance.
4.srt	00:34:53.960 --> 00:35:01.590	So, pole 0 filter any filter can be implemented using a pole 0 filter.
4.srt	00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:09.220	So, I can implement P z and I can implement Q z and I can implement H z.
4.srt	00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:14.150	Now, how it is look like this?
4.srt	00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:21.930	If you see the mathematics, so there is a number of pole m number of 0 if it is order is m, m number of 0 and n number of pole.
4.srt	00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.980	So, every pole and 0 has a complex conjugate.
4.srt	00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.320	So, that I will discuss later on that every pole has a complex conjugate if it is complex pole complex 0.
4.srt	00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.570	So, it is if the real value H z is real then every pole on every 0 complex pole has its conjugate value.
4.srt	00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:44.190	So, if there is a pole in here, there will be a conjugate value pole in here.
4.srt	00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:53.550	So, it is the unit circle if all poles are lying inside the unit circle then we can say this is a causal and stable filter.
4.srt	00:35:54.890 --> 00:36:00.800	Now, how do we implement filter in digital domain?
4.srt	00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:20.950	So, I can say H z has an impulse response H z has an impulse response or I can say H z in time domain it is nothing but H n. So, H n has an impulse response it can be finite or it can be infinite or non finite.
4.srt	00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.160	So, if I say if it is infinite finite.
4.srt	00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.240	So, if it can be finite or infinite.
4.srt	00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:38.160	So, if I say that it has a finite impulse response then we said implementation is called FIR filter finite impulse response filter.
4.srt	00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:40.930	impulse response filter.
4.srt	00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.970	Now, what do you mean by a filter?
4.srt	00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:47.280	That is very important.
4.srt	00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.050	What do you mean by a filter?
4.srt	00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:59.840	So, suppose I filter means I something is unwanted I want to discard that is filter.
4.srt	00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:06.820	Now, in a signal suppose I have a signal which has a frequency response let us all frequency are present.
4.srt	00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:08.740	Now, I want to cut down.
4.srt	00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:17.010	after 5 kilohertz I want signal or system should not produce let signal should not produce any response.
4.srt	00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:35.170	That means, that filter is that filter frequency response is that up to 500 kilohertz or 500 less 500 hertz I want response should be like this and after 500 hertz I do not want anything.
4.srt	00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.470	So, that means, 0 to 500 hertz.
4.srt	00:37:39.810 --> 00:38:02.170	all frequency components should pass to the output and after 500 hertz none of the component should pass to the output then it is called low pass filter because low frequency component is pass high frequency component is attenuated to 0 ok.
4.srt	00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:11.120	So, there may be I may want this type that frequency component between 500 hertz to 1.5 kilohertz may pass.
4.srt	00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:13.250	pass.
4.srt	00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:17.250	This portion also becomes 0 and this portion also becomes 0.
4.srt	00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:36.300	So, that is my requirement or I may say I this is called band pass filter or I may say I want a filter after 1.5 kilo hertz all frequencies should pass below 1.5 kilo hertz none of the frequencies should be there.
4.srt	00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.940	So, that should be 0 that is called high pass filter.
4.srt	00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.130	So, it is low pass filter it is band pass filter, it is high pass filter.
4.srt	00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:54.380	That is my ideal filter frequency response I want ok.
4.srt	00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:45.400	This is the ideal response, but if I implement it with a finite impulse response filter, then I instead of getting that single that this pass band with 1 instead of this if you see this is flat 1, here I can get a some kind of variation that is called pass band repeal or instead of sharp cut off I can get a transit point that is called transitory response and after that instead of 0 I can get some signal here also that is called stop band repeal pass band repeal stop band repeal and filter transition transition bandwidth.
4.srt	00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:54.930	So, where the amplitude is 1 to 0 is transitory, so that transitory portion that frequency range is called transition bandwidth.
4.srt	00:39:55.490 --> 00:40:02.300	So, if you say normalize edge then the peak repeal pass band, peak repeal in stop band and normalize transition bandwidth.
4.srt	00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:08.860	So, this point to this point is called normalized transition bandwidth.
4.srt	00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.410	So, this is pass band frequency, this is a stop band frequency where I want to stop the filter.
4.srt	00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.450	So, this bandwidth is called stop transition bandwidth ok.
4.srt	00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.040	So, how do you implement the filter F I R O A?
4.srt	00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.280	Two methods.
4.srt	00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:45.570	So, I can say that let us I have a filter whose response is h n. If I know the transfer function time domain transfer function of the filter, then I convolve the input signal I get the output of the filter or what I can do I can take the frequency response of the filter which is h k.
4.srt	00:40:47.060 --> 00:41:17.820	and I can take the frequency response of the input signal x k and multiply h k into x k I get y k then I take the IDFT to get the y n. So, either I can implement in frequency domain I can frequency domain transfer the h k then I can get take the time domain signal in frequency domain.
4.srt	00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:22.600	domain, multiply both and get the output and take the IDFT, get the input.
4.srt	00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:27.720	So, these are the two implementations, either frequency domain implementation or time domain implementation.
4.srt	00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.880	So, have you understand?
4.srt	00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:41.400	Either I can implement the filter in time domain or I can implement the filter in frequency domain.
4.srt	00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:48.770	Now, suppose I want to implement the filter in time domain or frequency domain or any domain when I want to implement.
4.srt	00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:52.330	how do you implement it FIR filter implementation.
4.srt	00:41:52.680 --> 00:42:04.690	So, suppose I have a long signal long signal is there there is a long signal if I want take the whole signal.
4.srt	00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:06.870	So, signal may be huge signal.
4.srt	00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.750	So, I do not want to take the whole signal at a time then what I have to do let us I have to cut the signal this portion and apply the filter here then the take the next chunk, next chunk, next chunk I can do that way.
4.srt	00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.020	Once I cut the filter what I am doing?
4.srt	00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:48.370	Whether I take the DFT or filter once I cut the cut the signal in a chunk that means, if this is x n I am multiplying x n with a window function which is 1 within the interval let us it is L minus 1 0 to L minus 1.
4.srt	00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:53.620	So, 0 to L minus 1 window function is a amplitude is 1.
4.srt	00:42:54.570 --> 00:43:01.010	1 after that it amplitude is 0 that is window function.
4.srt	00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:12.700	So, if it is 1 if it is this type of window I am not multiplying the signal with any function this is called rectangular window.
4.srt	00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:23.750	Now, once I do the rectangular window then my frequency response of the output frequency is y n y n if I take the y k.
4.srt	00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:30.470	is also Y k is also contain the frequency response of this window function.
4.srt	00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:42.240	So, I am not getting the exact frequency response only the filter and input signal, but also it is combined with window function frequency response.
4.srt	00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.920	That is why I will get the different kinds of repeal.
4.srt	00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:55.510	So, if you see different kind of window function are defined to reduce the different repeal stop band repeal and pass band repeal.
4.srt	00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:01.640	function and different kind of window function is defined that is called blackman window, hamming window, hanning window, kaiser window.
4.srt	00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:15.890	So, all every everybody has an window function that is multiply with the input signal and then convolve with the filter transfer function I get the output.
4.srt	00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:24.630	So, if I implement the filter, so this is the common window window frequency response if it is frequency response of the rectangular window if you see like this.
4.srt	00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.940	So, ripple is much more.
4.srt	00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:33.540	if I want to butter black man window frequency response is like the hamming window this, hanging window this.
4.srt	00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:37.380	So, most cases hanging window we are using if it is a refill is very less.
4.srt	00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.190	So, different window function has different kind of frequency response.
4.srt	00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:47.880	This frequency response will be combined with the frequency response of the signal and pass through the filter.
4.srt	00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:55.760	So, it is time domain multiplication that means window multiply with the signal in time domain.
4.srt	00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.310	So, frequency domain it will be convolution.
4.srt	00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:10.860	So, x k will be convolved with window function and then multiply with frequency response of the filter.
4.srt	00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.210	So, this is happening.
4.srt	00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.830	Details I will discuss when I discuss about the STFT short term frequency short term Fourier transform.
4.srt	00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:22.670	Now, if you see the example, example implementation for a time domain signal.
4.srt	00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:27.270	Suppose, I want to design a low pass filter cutoff frequency is omega c.
4.srt	00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:29.030	So, this is the frequency response of the filter.
4.srt	00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:35.720	So, user in implementation of filter user will provide the frequency response of the filter.
4.srt	00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:52.890	I have to design design if I want to if I want to design in time domain then I have to derive the time domain representation or time domain transfer function or time domain impulse response of the filter and then convert with the input signal.
4.srt	00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.400	So, if I do that I will get this kind of response.
4.srt	00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.600	and then I can implement it in time domain.
4.srt	00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:10.120	So, if you see the book there is a different so different window has different type of transition bandwidth and peak side lobe.
4.srt	00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:15.280	So, this is the ripple in peak side lobe and this is the transition bandwidth.
4.srt	00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.940	So, if I rectangular filter the order of the filter is m then transition bandwidth delta is nothing but a 4 pi by m. So, m is the order of the filter if it implement the filter in FIR way.
4.srt	00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:39.030	So, I said finite impulse response ideally and filter has an infinite impulse.
4.srt	00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:48.010	So, I truncated the infinite impulse to a finite number if it is m then m is called order of the filter.
4.srt	00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:58.240	Ideally if I want to design a low pass filter this is infinite impulse response once I truncated it I cannot get this half.
4.srt	00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:02.050	I should use which kind of window I should apply.
4.srt	00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.990	Next one, how do I implement a band pass filter?
4.srt	00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:19.680	So, suppose I implement a low pass filter up to 500 kilohertz, let us it is 500 hertz.
4.srt	00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.850	So, bandwidth is 500 hertz.
4.srt	00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:29.710	Now, I want to implement a band pass filter of 500 hertz bandwidth.
4.srt	00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.330	with the frequency between the 1.5 kilohertz to 2 kilohertz.
4.srt	00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.350	So, what I will do?
4.srt	00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:44.370	I will just shift this low pass filter to 1.5 kilohertz frequency so that I get this one.
4.srt	00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:48.180	Understand or not?
4.srt	00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.860	So, it is nothing but a frequency shifting of the low pass filter.
4.srt	00:47:51.860 --> 00:48:00.340	So, any band pass filter I can implement just implement the low pass filter of the desired bandwidth and shift here that frequency response.
4.srt	00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.680	where you want to implement the band pass filter.
4.srt	00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.660	Similarly, suppose I want to design a high pass filter of 1.5 kilohertz.
4.srt	00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:19.770	If the sampling frequency of the signal is 8 kilohertz, then in frequency scale, what is the maximum signal?
4.srt	00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:21.740	Up to 8 kilohertz I can get.
4.srt	00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:26.380	Baseband signal is 4 kilohertz again.
4.srt	00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:28.930	Even I can get the baseband signal is 4 kilohertz.
4.srt	00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:32.820	So, it is nothing but a band pass filter.
4.srt	00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:35.370	1.5 kilohertz to 4 kilohertz.
4.srt	00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:41.740	So, I design that filter and shifted at 1.5 kilohertz, I get the high cost filter.
4.srt	00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.940	So, that way I can design the filter.
4.srt	00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:56.050	Digital filter design I am not going here because that you can that is prerequisite of this course that if you want to know the digital filter design, digital signal processing you have to study.
4.srt	00:48:56.050 --> 00:49:00.310	I just give you some concept of the or you can say that this is overview of DSP.
4.srt	00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:05.860	So, how to implement an IIR filter there is a lot of methodology are there.
4.srt	00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:22.620	I can take that derive that filter transfer function in S domain then go to the bilinear transformation to make it Z domain and once I get the Z domain transfer function I can use a discrete system to design that transfer function.
4.srt	00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.210	So, that way we can implement.
4.srt	00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:31.380	So, this is the prerequisite part which I will be referred many times during the speech processing class.
4.srt	00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.250	So, this is the overview of DSP.
4.srt	00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:40.390	Please go through these slides if it is there is a suppose you do not cover the DSP.
4.srt	00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.130	then if you do not understand the particular point then you read that dsp book proakis banalokis or whatever ah digital signal parsing book you can read and also you can post that i am not understand this portion then i will help whatever way i can do because if i just consider the dsp then i am not able to complete the speech part so i am just truncated that just i just for summarize the dsp required dsp things in here and some dsp also i require higher end dsp signal signal signal parsing algorithm i will be used and that time I will describe that things when I will use them.
4.srt	00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:16.970	So, thank you.
5.srt	00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.379	Good morning.
5.srt	00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:51.320	So, let us start with that, start with the course that first class we have explained that introduction of the speech processing that things and second class recording Now, if you record a speech and if you just display the speech it will look like this if you see here this portion I have not spoken anything this portion let us I started spoken this is called unvoiced sound some noisy sound may be there then there is a voice sound is generated.
5.srt	00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:58.159	So, normally in speech I can three part one is silence one is unvoiced another one is a voiced.
5.srt	00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.769	So, silence means when I am not taking anything nothing is coming out from the mouth.
5.srt	00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:12.890	is a silence part, then there may be a unvoiced expression will be there or friction will be there and there will be a voice sound.
5.srt	00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:30.280	Now how do I produce this kind of sound and how do I what the meaning how when I communicate a message what kind of different voice sound and different silence and different unvoiced sounds I have produced that you do not know that things.
5.srt	00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.109	So that is the speech production system how the different kind of sound is produced by the human being.
5.srt	00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:41.539	Now if you take the basic definition, somebody will ask you what is speech?
5.srt	00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:43.419	What is speech?
5.srt	00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:46.629	Speech is a composed of a sequence of sound.
5.srt	00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:48.589	Speech is nothing but a sound.
5.srt	00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:51.119	Speech is not signal or not kind of things.
5.srt	00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.079	So human being use speech to communicate message from one person to another person.
5.srt	00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:03.379	So it may be transmitted to electronics media or what kind of that is different business.
5.srt	00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.049	So speech is a composed of a sequence of sound which is produced by the speech.
5.srt	00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.519	human vocal cords now once i say sound what is sound what kinds of sound sounds or phonemes serve as a symbolic representation of information to share between human being if i say i want to communicate a message from one human being to another human being or human being to machine or machine to machine in that case what i required The speech is a composition of different sound.
5.srt	00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.879	Now what is sound?
5.srt	00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:53.579	Sound serves a symbolic representation of information which I want to communicate.
5.srt	00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.319	That information has to be symbolically represent so that it can understand by the listeners.
5.srt	00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:08.929	So arrangement of sound or phoneme, sound is called phoneme, basic unit of sound is called phoneme.
5.srt	00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:11.969	And it should not be haphazardly arranged.
5.srt	00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:21.580	It should be arranged in some specific manner which govern by the language rule so that the listeners can understand.
5.srt	00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:39.409	Suppose if I say Kolkata, if I say Kolkata, let us there is a sound Kolkata, ko, ko, o, lo, ko, a, ta, to and a, all the sounds are there.
5.srt	00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.469	So, ko is a sound, o is a sound.
5.srt	00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:54.840	then law is a sounds, again co is a sounds, then again a is a sounds, then again to is a sounds, then again a is a sounds.
5.srt	00:03:55.789 --> 00:04:13.769	So, if those sounds are pronounced or composed in a sequence, so that then a message that I am saying Kolkata is transmitted from talker to listener and those.
5.srt	00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:52.279	of sounds are governed by the language rule i cannot compose ok la la then ko any arbitrary composition will not make any sense although individual sound has a sense and this composition is governed by the language rule ok if i say japanese chinese suppose i dont know if some speaker spoken chinese he is speaking the sounds in a sound composition may be some of the sound i know but i do not intend or i cannot identify the intended message he want to communicate because we dont know the language rule by which the sequence of sounds are arranged that is linguistics so linguistics is the study of the rule of those rule how do i human being produce different sequence of sound to communicate different kinds of message there may be different kind of things different kind of you can say the different kind of rules are applicable for rules may vary from language to language so discipline which study those things is called linguistics then how the different sound is produced or study of the individual sounds is called phonetics.
5.srt	00:05:53.209 --> 00:06:01.609	Suppose, co this is individual sound, so sound of individual sounds that study is called phonetics.
5.srt	00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:12.869	How the sounds are governed by the rule language rule for making the valid composition is the study of language that is called linguistics.
5.srt	00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.299	Here I am explain the details of the phonetics.
5.srt	00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.389	So, it is produced by a human being in an acoustic waveform.
5.srt	00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:33.289	So, I will cover the acoustic phonetics and articulatory phonetics.
5.srt	00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:37.159	Once the sound is coming in the air, it is the acoustic.
5.srt	00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:48.489	So, I have to know the acoustic part of the phonetics and how we produce the different sound using this vocal track is the articulatory phonetics.
5.srt	00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:50.779	So, the phonetics has two parts.
5.srt	00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:56.649	phonetics one is called acoustic phonetics another is called articulatory phonetics so i will details cover those things because we have to understand the sound but composition of sound in the study of linguistics so there may be a phonology there may be a language rule grammar and there may be a some kind of arrangement pragmatic paralinguistics linguistics all kinds of rules will be there ok now let us look how the human track look like this is the x-ray of human vocal this whole whole whole systems x-ray whole systems there is a vocal cords and there is a tube articulatory tube whole system x-ray is look like this if i take the mri this is taken from ah professor sinaran so if you see that mri of the human vocal track which look like this this is the lip then there is a tongue whose lip tip of the tongue is open back portion is closed then there will be a vocal cord here.
5.srt	00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:17.199	So, if I schematically represent this thing it will look like lip then tongue tip of the tongue is open and back the bottom is closed bottom is fixed with the lower jaw then this is the palate then there is a velum because we have a nasal cavity and we have a oral cavity.
5.srt	00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:33.299	So, velum may be closed or velum may be open then there will be a pharyngeal walls discreetly Now, if I take the schematic representation of the speech production system, it will look like this.
5.srt	00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:37.259	How the speech is produced by human being?
5.srt	00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.879	This is schematic representation.
5.srt	00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.179	So, there is a lungs.
5.srt	00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.949	So, what is the source of the sound?
5.srt	00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:50.559	If you see, forget about the speech, the source of sound is nothing but a vibration.
5.srt	00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:56.529	If I want to generate a sound, sound is nothing but a mechanical oscillation.
5.srt	00:08:57.529 --> 00:08:59.349	So, it is nothing but a mechanical oscillation.
5.srt	00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:05.679	So, a mechanical body is vibrating and sound is acoustics wave is generated.
5.srt	00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:11.729	Now, vibration of mechanical body require external force.
5.srt	00:09:12.309 --> 00:09:14.379	I require a force to vibrate the body.
5.srt	00:09:15.369 --> 00:09:27.629	Now, if you see if I have a membrane connect a membrane if I pass the air very thin membrane is closed and if I pass air in force the membrane will vibrate.
5.srt	00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:05.689	and sound will be produced in childhood if you see the kite which is flying in the sky and there is a some membrane is attached and membrane is vibrating in the air and producing a sound this is childhood ah in india people are use that things so there is a source of you can say the source external force is required so during the speech production the lungs when i take the ah the air inhale and i gradually exalted that air and produce different sound by constructing the different location of the tube.
5.srt	00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:13.879	So, lungs produce or give the air pressure which is required to the production of sound.
5.srt	00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:20.259	So, this is the force and once this lungs press the air to upwards there is a vocal chord.
5.srt	00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:25.689	So, vocal chords are generally open when you take inhale.
5.srt	00:10:59.209 --> 00:11:06.919	If I want to speak something the vocal cords are has to be closed if it is open no sound so sound there is no sound is coming from the mouth so if it is vocal cord is closed then when the air is passing through the vocal cords it is a membrane and if the membrane is exposed to a high velocity of air so the that that create that vibration in the membrane so that vibration cause the sound and pass through the cavity now if i say tongue We have a tongue, tongue separate the cavity in two part, one is called back cavity, one is the front cavity.
5.srt	00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:15.549	And we have a vellum, if you see the vellum either vellum can be closed or vellum can be open.
5.srt	00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:24.279	If vellum is open and oral cavity is closed, then the air will passes through the nose, so nasal cavity is involved.
5.srt	00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:29.620	If the vellum is closed, the sound is only passed through the mouth that is called mouth.
5.srt	00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:30.699	oral cavity.
5.srt	00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:42.839	So, if there is that is a two kinds of sound either vellum may be closed or open if vellum is open then the sounds become nasal because nasal cavity is involved.
5.srt	00:11:43.149 --> 00:11:50.749	If the vellum is open a closed then nasal cavity is destruct from that cavity then it is called oral sound.
5.srt	00:11:51.379 --> 00:12:00.049	So, the sound is produced using this mechanism lungs create the pressure, pressure goes upward.
5.srt	00:12:00.609 --> 00:12:14.989	If the vocal cords are closed then the vibration will produce and that vibration create the sound and that sound is modified depending on the tube structure when it passes through the tube.
5.srt	00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:29.989	So I can say in human speech production system has a two part, one is the source here the source of sound is vocal cords and lungs only the provide the pressure.
5.srt	00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:31.669	So one is the source.
5.srt	00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:46.079	And once the sound is produced that source is passes through the cavity or you can the tube this tube and its modify to create the different count kinds of sound.
5.srt	00:12:46.979 --> 00:12:58.659	Once the source create the sound when it is passes through the cavity depending on the structure of this tube its modify and it produce different kinds of sound.
5.srt	00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:47.000	So I have a source and I have a tube this is the two two part of the sound production so now goes to the source what is how the what is vocal cords how it is look like if you see the vocal cords is look like this this picture now if you see that air is coming from the lungs if the vocal cord is closed then the air air air is flow air flow will be obstructed and the velocity of the air will be will be different different because air pressure in here will be increased air pressure will be decreased once it is little bit of open there will process through this vocal vocal cords and create the vibration So, that is the sound this is the original picture or you can say that is the endoscopy picture of the vocal cord.
5.srt	00:13:47.219 --> 00:13:51.349	This is the closed position of the vocal cord, this is the open position of the vocal cord.
5.srt	00:13:51.969 --> 00:13:56.109	So, this is the vocal cord structure, this is the closed position, this is the open position.
5.srt	00:13:56.339 --> 00:14:03.279	Now, if you see the vocal cords is closed it is not like a this thyroid movement.
5.srt	00:14:03.659 --> 00:14:09.259	One end of the vocal cord is always fixed and it is closed and open in the other end.
5.srt	00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:13.429	And that creates the sound.
5.srt	00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:18.689	So, now if I take the schematic structure of this, this will look like this.
5.srt	00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:22.419	So, different cartilage and close this either.
5.srt	00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.480	So, movement of the vocal cords depend on the muscle movement.
5.srt	00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:33.720	Now, one end is closed, this end vocal cord is closed and this end is the back end is open.
5.srt	00:14:34.319 --> 00:14:39.600	Now, once either it can be closed either or it will be totally open.
5.srt	00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.059	So, there is no sound breathing.
5.srt	00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:51.019	if it is closed voiced if it is slightly if it is open but the tube can produce a noise kind of sound that is called unvoiced sound ok.
5.srt	00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.159	So, unvoiced voiced and silence region I have seen in the first slides in here.
5.srt	00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:03.360	Now, if I see the glottal flow how the air is flow in the glottis.
5.srt	00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:09.519	So, once the vocal cord is closed if the vocal cord is closed no air can flow.
5.srt	00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.350	So, either it is gradually open.
5.srt	00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:16.589	os closed once its closed air flow stopped and once Mehran opened one flow it increases and increases and again it is a decreases decreases so this is a flow diagram air flow increases and again decreases and closed page again it is open and again it is closed so i can say either of complete open to open is a period or close to close is a period ok and if i take the difference of the flow which create so difference of the flow will create the sound vibration so difference if i differentiate this thing it will be look like this which create the vocal cord vibration so this is the differentiation of the flow now if you see that this tip to this tip is a period ok either close to close is a period or open to open is a period ok.
5.srt	00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:26.209	So, this is source I can show you the diagram in here this is called engineering model of the source.
5.srt	00:16:26.459 --> 00:16:40.119	So, how do the how what is the engineering model if you see this is the lungs ok. Now, vocal cords any mechanical vibration is not any sound production of the sound is nothing, but a mechanical vibration.
5.srt	00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:44.839	So, what is the what is the form of a mechanical oscillator there is a spring.
5.srt	00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.769	there is a mass and there is a mechanical damping.
5.srt	00:16:51.269 --> 00:17:04.599	This is the mass, this is the spring constant S and this is the mechanical damping R m. So, air acts as a force on this mechanical oscillation.
5.srt	00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.680	So, I can say two vocal cords can be act as a mechanical oscillator and that oscillate by the force which is coming from the lungs ok and that is u g if you see the u g mechanical oscillation produce the acoustics wave so acoustics wave has a volume velocity and is a pressure wave it has a volume velocity ok so it is a volume velocity u g particle velocity and from you can multiply for fixed unit fixed volume is a volume velocity ok now u g is the air flow velocity volume velocity will come through this different vocal tract shape ok so now if you see that whole track the source is nothing but a mechanical oscillator it create the vibration once it create mechanical oscillator its create the vibration lets it has create the vibration is term of impulse so source can be model using a impulse source.
5.srt	00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.080	Now, this has to be passes through this tube, this is a tube.
5.srt	00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:36.940	Now tube can form different structure using the tongue, lip and velum movement.
5.srt	00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:45.590	Now if you see I can move the tongue in upward, I can back of the tongue can be raised, tongue tip can be touches in the upper palate.
5.srt	00:18:45.819 --> 00:18:54.720	So, when we speak if you see the upper palate is fixed, lower palate upper this upper portion is fixed upper palate is fixed.
5.srt	00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.519	Now lower portion lower jaw upper jaw is fixed and lower jaw is moving if you see.
5.srt	00:18:58.519 --> 00:19:12.009	So, I can move the either lip I can close the lip I can open the lip or I can move the tongue to divide the cavity in different structures.
5.srt	00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.769	So, I can say when this vibration.
5.srt	00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:25.940	through a different kinds of tube structure can produce different kind of sound cascading tube.
5.srt	00:19:26.769 --> 00:19:43.980	So, if I consider that things then I can say this is the source of the sound production and that source sound is passes through the different structure of the cavity and different time to produce the different kind of sound sequence.
5.srt	00:19:47.829 --> 00:20:00.619	So, I can say that source is a impulse response that can be passes through a filter depending on the filter structures different sound can be generated.
5.srt	00:20:02.699 --> 00:20:08.569	So, in engineering model or human production system if I see it is a source filter model.
5.srt	00:20:08.969 --> 00:20:17.839	So, vocal code is producing the source which is nothing but a impulse either sound is present.
5.srt	00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:55.089	or sound is absent either source can be present or source can be absent then it is passes through a filter this is time varying filter different time structure of the tube will be different to produce different kind of sound let this is ascent or this is speech So, digital circuits will come later on.
5.srt	00:20:55.659 --> 00:21:04.649	So, I can say whole human speech production system can be modeled using a source filter model.
5.srt	00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:15.679	So, in I can say I can study the source or I can study the filter combine the both I will get the speech.
5.srt	00:21:19.019 --> 00:21:31.939	So, who produce different kind of sound depending on the structure of the filter source either source vocal vocal cord can vibrate or vocal cord without vibration.
5.srt	00:21:49.219 --> 00:21:52.989	So, either source can be present that is called voice sound either source can be absent that is called un voice sound or voice sound when is produced when it pass through the filter it can produce the different kind of voice sound different kind of voice speech.
5.srt	00:21:53.959 --> 00:22:03.319	Now if I see the I will come this one again I will come when I talk about the tube modeling, but here I will explain.
5.srt	00:22:03.319 --> 00:22:17.939	So, excitation impulse is nothing but a excitation parameters excitation is generated and that excitation part of the going to the linear time varying system filter and I get the speech.
5.srt	00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:20.369	So, this filter I have to model.
5.srt	00:22:52.569 --> 00:23:01.000	this excitation part I have to model ok now if I say what are the properties of this source if you see if it is impulse then it has a period impulse is a period so which is the fundamental frequency of the source human being also has a fundamental frequency of the speech is a quasi periodic signal it is not exactly periodic So, human being also produce different kind of this source fundamental frequency depending on the requirement.
5.srt	00:23:02.769 --> 00:23:10.669	When we speak we never speak in a single fundamental frequency that will become too mechanical to hearing.
5.srt	00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:17.980	So, fundamental frequency are gradually moving to provide the melody on the speech.
5.srt	00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:25.470	Think about singing filter produce the different sound for content purpose.
5.srt	00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:33.849	but melody is defined by the source itself if you singing think about the singing the control of the fundamental frequency all the notes are nothing but a movement of the fundamental frequency so those controlling of the fundamental frequency is generated by the source so movement of the vocal chords i will discuss how this vocal chord movement how the vocal chord produce different fundamental frequency to by varying the tension of the vocal chord and position of the vocal chord so that is i will discuss in later class in during the modeling so movement of the vocal chord tension can change by two types one is called forward and backward movement one is vertical movement so if the source or fundamental frequency is the property so fundamental frequency is the property of the source and filter responsible for producing different kind of sound.
5.srt	00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:41.619	So, if you know the digital filter, how the digital filter is characterized depending on the frequency response.
5.srt	00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:56.220	So, if I say the digital filter is represented by H s, you know the Laplace transform H s or you can say the H n whatever H s represent the frequency response of the filter.
5.srt	00:24:56.549 --> 00:25:01.630	So, if the frequency response of the filter is look like this and the source is passing.
5.srt	00:27:05.609 --> 00:27:08.500	but the impulse response contain all the fundamental frequency all the frequency less same height and this is the you can say time and this is the frequency sorry this is the this is the this is the frequency and this is the power this is the frequency this is the power so as per the signal processing model when the source is passes through a filter source that signal will convolve with the filter signal to produce the speech in frequency domain convolution is nothing but a multiplication so if i say in signal little bit of signal forcing if i if i apply here if i say source is nothing but a e t and filter is nothing but a h t ok so output speech is s t so s t is nothing but a h t convolve with with e t if i take the laplace transform in frequency domain or z transform let us take the laplace transform then s s laplace domain is nothing but a h s multiply by s so frequency response of the filter will be multiply with the frequency response of the source and produce the speech so different sound is responsible by the filter source is responsible either there will be a voicing or there will be a no voicing either there will be a voicing signal or there will be a no voicing so response so this is nothing but a multiplication ok but source provide the fundamental frequency of the speech so in case of singing when you say char node char a gamma path so actually you are controlling the the fundamental frequency of the vocal chords.
5.srt	00:27:09.089 --> 00:27:20.799	So, the controlling of the fundamental frequency which is I will talk about the prosody modeling part, I will details mathematical explanation I will given that how this fundamental frequency of the vocal chords can be changed.
5.srt	00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:37.169	Now, if you see the singers are practicing in morning to touching up the some or you can see the comment like that you have your upper note is not that clear lower note is clear what is meaning, meaning is that the changing of the fundamental frequency.
5.srt	00:28:38.019 --> 00:28:43.450	from lower to high or high to low so upper node and lower node that changing or controlling of the this vocal chord is important so you are practicing controlling of the vocal chords by so that you can touch the perfect node ok during the speaking also we change this vocal chord fundamental frequency with respect to time to provide the melody on the speech ok now some fact if you see so sound source and sound has a filter so acoustic the acoustics of male and female vowel differ reliably along it to different dimension so sound can be this s t is depends on the source and depends on the filter source if it is voice sound source is exist and source provide the fundamental frequency and filter modify that source and produce different voice sounds that may be vowel or that may be a voice consonant also ok.
5.srt	00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.309	So, it is not necessary it will be vowel it may be a consonant voice consonant also.
5.srt	00:28:47.589 --> 00:28:52.759	So, source modify by the filter producing different kind of sound.
5.srt	00:28:53.149 --> 00:29:08.369	So, fundamental frequency or F 0 sometime we say pitch F 0 is sometime defined as pitch but pitch is a perceptual dimension parameter F 0.
5.srt	00:31:42.249 --> 00:31:47.119	is the physical dimension of the parameter f 0 can be measured but pitch is perceptual which cannot be measured ok so f 0 f 0 of the source depend on the source and different sounds which depend by the filter so if i say the human being different human being now male versus female male versus female if you see f 0 depend on the vocal cord length vocal cord mass those two things if you see the vocal cord is close descent if the length of the vocal cord is increases what will happen the fundamental frequency will be decreases if the mass of the vocal cord is increases fundamental frequency will be decreases if you see the drum huge membrane drum mass length is increase area is increases fundamental frequency is decreases if you take a short membrane if sound then fundamental frequency will be increased so for a woman since the vocal chord length is shorter their fundamental frequency is higher if you see the woman singer they say the your base scale is b sharp what do you mean by b sharp average fundamental frequency in the level of the average fundamental frequency so if it is woman then the higher the f 0 f 0 average f 0 will be very high not compared to male but for a male since the vocal cord length is longer the fundamental frequency is shorter means average low average is lower so average fundamental frequency for a male is lower than the average fundamental frequency of female then filter so filter depends on the characteristics of its frequency response now if i say h s is a transfer function of the filter if you are electronic students you know electronic or electrical students or you know signal pausing then h s is nothing but a system functions so that systems depend on what system has a property some pole and zero so from there i will define that formant frequency in the next class so that is called formant or resonance frequency based on the resonant frequency different sound is I will explain in the next class what do you mean by pole and resonance frequency.
5.srt	00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:50.369	So, those is speech it is called formant.
5.srt	00:31:50.939 --> 00:32:03.549	So, in case of woman since the length of the vocal chord is shorter the formant frequency is little bit of higher longer in case of man.
5.srt	00:32:03.829 --> 00:32:06.639	So, formant frequency is little bit of lower.
5.srt	00:32:06.819 --> 00:32:11.359	So, that is the difference between the male and female speech.
5.srt	00:32:11.489 --> 00:32:12.369	If it is child.
5.srt	00:32:44.249 --> 00:32:58.819	the fundamental frequency much more higher because the length of the vocal cord is much shorter and the formant frequency will be higher because the length of the vocal cord is shorter so i can say that formant frequency depends on length of the vocal tract and also other some properties we will discuss later on when we model this vocal tract so if the length is increases the formant frequency will be different so i can say If average if I can say personalize the speech means my vocal cord or vocal this length of this ah vocal track or you can say length of this tube may not be exactly equal to other person.
5.srt	00:32:59.809 --> 00:33:07.689	So, if it is not equal then I should have a form and structure which will be different from the other people.
5.srt	00:33:14.989 --> 00:33:18.059	So, there may be some information exists from which I can identify the person.
5.srt	00:33:18.099 --> 00:33:25.859	So, I can exploit that information to recognize the biometric or biometric signature of the person.
5.srt	00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:34.439	Similarly, shows vocal cords, my vocal cords length and weight will be different from somebody else.
5.srt	00:33:34.979 --> 00:33:42.089	So, there may be a some parameter exist here also by which I can identify the person.
5.srt	00:33:42.589 --> 00:33:45.429	So, biometric signature.
1.srt	00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:18.519	So, welcome welcome all.
1.srt	00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:24.640	So, this course is digital speech processing.
1.srt	00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:33.219	So, I will take this course in twenty hours that that means that half twenty hours lectures.
1.srt	00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.129	and this course mainly design for ah speech part not that ah soft computing and that part so this course you do not expect that i will taught about that h m m or i can taught about that deep learning those things i will not cover in this course this course mainly i covered the ah scientific or you can scientific aspects of the speech and how those speech can be digitized what kind of digital setup we should use how do you locate the different kind of speech signal in that recording.
1.srt	00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.739	So, all kinds of those things will be taught in this course.
1.srt	00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:27.279	So, if you see the course coverage, the course coverage mainly covered if you see all are on the aspects of the speech signal aspects, not that the aspects of soft computing and developing a system that kind of things.
1.srt	00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:39.569	But yes at the end of the course, I should cover some of the portions or some of the important speech processing application like that TTS, ASR many people are talking about the TTS and ASR.
1.srt	00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:52.729	But, I am believing that not only the TTSSR, there is a other kinds of speech application also like that second language acquisition, action conversion all kinds of things.
1.srt	00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:05.899	So, those we will discuss, I will discuss at the end of the course that whatever the speech processing we have done entire course, what is the main application of those kind of information in this course.
1.srt	00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.149	So, what I expect from the every learner that not that cover.
1.srt	00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.979	the course.
1.srt	00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:26.329	From the learner's perspective, as a learner of the course of digital speech processing, at the end of the whole course, you should able to do following this course objective.
1.srt	00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.579	What is the course objective?
1.srt	00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:38.370	First is categorize and label the different speech sound for a given speech signal based on the spectrographic view and time domain speech view.
1.srt	00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.969	So, not all those things are written in the slides.
1.srt	00:02:42.139 --> 00:03:14.259	I can say something on the here also so you see that categorize and label the different speech sound for a given speech signal based on the spectrographic view or time domain signal view so what I expect from the learner that what once I completed the course the learner should able to do or learner should able to categorize suppose I give you a speech signal and I told you to records a speech signal as your name.
1.srt	00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.240	you record your name you should able to record that ah that speech in a computer using a computer then using some ah you can say that open source softwares there are many speech processing softwares which are available using those software you should able to view the spectrogram and time domain signal and level the different speech signal point so for example suppose i say the level that a consonant to vowel or stop consonant to vowel transition so those things you will learn here how do i level which is top concern what is look like in speech domain and what is the transitory part what is content so those things you learn this course and you should able to use that knowledge for a labeling the speech signal for a given or of a given speech signal whatever i said that you can so in examination also i will sometimes i give you a spectrogram and told you that identify the words based on the manner of articulation of the speech so i can expect that you should develop a skill not that theory what is top concern what is articulatory place of that velar that palatal not all kind of things but given a speech signal i should able to categorize and level the speech signal next one explain the psychoacoustics and psycho or you can say the psychoacoustics properties of speech perception and speech production.
1.srt	00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:04.589	That is not that much of skill oriented things, but yes you should know what is the how the speech is produced and how the speech is perceived.
1.srt	00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:10.370	So there is a lot of problem I will solve using the speech perception and speech production.
1.srt	00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:19.829	Next one is suppose you know that this is a speech production mechanism that here the speech is produced using the vocal cords and there is a tube.
1.srt	00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.600	You should have experience with that.
1.srt	00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:31.110	If you see the float, I can use the float and pressing the different hole and I can create the different kind of sound.
1.srt	00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:40.650	So, how a human being can produce different kinds of sound using this vocal track?
1.srt	00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.570	So, this is a tube and there is a vocal cords which is vibrate and create the sound.
1.srt	00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:55.070	If you see the sun eye or if you see there is a membrane things in the beginning and there is a long tube.
1.srt	00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.199	to produce the different kind of sound.
1.srt	00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:07.750	So, using the uniform tube model, speech sound production and implementation of it using the signal parsing you should able to do.
1.srt	00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:19.009	So, I should explain how to model that this human vocal cords and how it should be implemented using the digital signal parsing techniques.
1.srt	00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:26.210	So, some part of digital signal parsing I will cover, but that I am assuming.
1.srt	00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.569	that you should know the basic part of digital signal processing.
1.srt	00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:40.449	So, using those principles, I should able to implement that human vocal track, that uniform tube model and I mathematically model also.
1.srt	00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:47.180	Next one, extract the fundamental frequency or different kind of speech parameters.
1.srt	00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:48.490	Why I require?
1.srt	00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.470	If you see, what is the purpose of this course?
1.srt	00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.269	If I say ask you, what is the purpose of studying the digital speech processing?
1.srt	00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.069	What is the subject?
1.srt	00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.460	But what is the purpose?
1.srt	00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:07.879	If you see today in modern scenario or you can say 21st century, there is a lot of research in speech domain.
1.srt	00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.340	Why?
1.srt	00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.590	Because if you think the human speech is the main communication media.
1.srt	00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:27.900	Let us take a scenario, even a person does not know the script or you can say the literate, you can say that he does not know the script, he does not know the grammar.
1.srt	00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.110	but he can speak effectively he can speak so i can say the speak is the speech is the common natural mode of communication among the human being even speech is the sound is the communication among that any live things or you can think about that also so but if you see consider the human being speech is the most you can say the most easiest or you can every people use the speech mode communication or most natural communication medium.
1.srt	00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.759	So, what scientist want?
1.srt	00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:10.769	Scientist want can machine will act like a human being.
1.srt	00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:17.810	Today there is a lot of artificial intelligence, lot of soft computing, lots of human intelligence we talk about.
1.srt	00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:29.969	Now, scientist are trying to develop that can I develop an algorithm or can I develop an systems by which a human being can talk to a machine.
1.srt	00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:36.019	Think about an application, suppose you go to the railway stations to buy a ticket.
1.srt	00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:47.599	So, instead of giving instruction to the machine by dialing 1, 2, 3, if you want this dial 1, dial 2 kind of things you can replace with the kiosk with the speech mode.
1.srt	00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:59.110	I want to buy a ticket for Kharagpur to Havda, I just told to the computer, computer give me the ticket and then computer how much money, the computer give you this amount of money, give you the money.
1.srt	00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:04.669	lot of this kind of spontaneous communication is required.
1.srt	00:09:05.099 --> 00:09:33.579	Another if you think there is a lot of other aspects speech communication think about the security, biometric speech speech can be used for one of the biometric for the human being that is why the speaker verification, speaker recognition, human voice identity all kinds of business are going on because speech carries the speaker biometric because every speaker produce the speech to communicate the information.
1.srt	00:09:34.189 --> 00:09:39.740	During the production, he impose some signature of that person also.
1.srt	00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:42.379	So, that kind of things is going on.
1.srt	00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:49.129	Similarly, other communication, think about the pure communication thing, forget about this kind of technology.
1.srt	00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:57.689	That human communication, telephone, I want to send a voice from one point to another point.
1.srt	00:09:58.209 --> 00:10:06.639	Now, how can I today, if you see that today is that IP based communication, I want that this channel cost is so high.
1.srt	00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:09.639	So, can I reduce the channel cost, reduce the bandwidth.
1.srt	00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:11.939	So, all kind of things we want to do.
1.srt	00:10:11.939 --> 00:10:13.259	So, that is all speech coding.
1.srt	00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:24.579	How do I develop an efficient algorithm so that with a minimum cost I can transfer a signal speech signal from here to here in a real time situation.
1.srt	00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:33.299	So, I want some kind of algorithm or compression kind of things which can compress my speech and transfer that things.
1.srt	00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:41.239	Think about that audio CD, audio CD, think music CD or you can say that vocalist that song CD.
1.srt	00:10:41.789 --> 00:10:46.870	Earlier a CD can contain 7 to 10 songs if it is stored in original format.
1.srt	00:10:47.089 --> 00:10:52.009	Now think about MP3, a compression technique, speech coding compression technique.
1.srt	00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:56.929	MP3, I can compress 160 songs in single CD.
1.srt	00:10:58.439 --> 00:11:02.319	So, speech coding is also another aspect.
1.srt	00:11:03.289 --> 00:11:15.579	So, while I doing the speech based any kinds of application, the first thing is that I have to know the speech, what the scientific aspects of the speech.
1.srt	00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:17.569	how it is behave like that.
1.srt	00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:20.039	So, all kinds of things we have to know.
1.srt	00:11:20.209 --> 00:11:46.289	So, the course aim is not to deal with that sub computing or those things, deal with that what is speech, how it is produced, which features I should exploit to develop the speech base application, which features carries what kind of information, what do how the human being produce the speech, how the human being perceive the speech, all kinds of things will be converted.
1.srt	00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:59.250	So, in this course I will cover the extraction of different speech parameters, details I will discuss during the speech parameter extraction, what do you mean by parameter and what kind of parameter you think is suitable.
1.srt	00:11:59.529 --> 00:12:06.850	So, those kind of things we will discuss, there is a signal processing algorithm, we use those algorithm, why we use this algorithm is very important.
1.srt	00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:16.360	Do not read anything which is just this has written, I have read it, I copied it and give the exam not this, why this is important is very important.
1.srt	00:12:16.909 --> 00:12:21.129	As an engineer or as a scientist, you should know why I am doing this thing.
1.srt	00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:28.659	So, different kind of speech parameter extraction, I will explain this parameter extraction algorithms are available in the book.
1.srt	00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:34.490	If you I have referred to books, you know that and you can go to those books, the all kinds of algorithm are explained.
1.srt	00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:46.480	But in the class, what I explain that why we are doing this kind of parameter, what is the advantage, what is the disadvantage, those kinds of things I will cover in this class.
1.srt	00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:50.500	There is a lot of segmental speech work is done.
1.srt	00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.750	If you see the TTS, most of the TTS are in Indian language.
1.srt	00:12:55.019 --> 00:12:58.420	I have developed one TTS in Indian language using different method.
1.srt	00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.830	I will explain that also, but it is not as like natural as human being.
1.srt	00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:07.670	So what we are missing is that speech prosodi.
1.srt	00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:16.519	So today if you heard any speech scientist, any speech lab, if you go there, lot of people are working on speech prosodi.
1.srt	00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:22.730	How, what do you mean by speech prosody and there is a different application also speech prosody.
1.srt	00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:39.190	Suppose, I give you one example that I have seen like this is very important may be very important research problem also think about that I have since I am dealing I am I am part of an center for education technology.
1.srt	00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:48.129	So, I have seen many lecture video which are recorded and even if foreign lecture video also I have seen which are recorded.
1.srt	00:13:48.890 --> 00:14:02.580	But if you find there is a difficulty of understanding of the speech of different language speaker, even all speakers are saying in the same let us English language.
1.srt	00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:19.490	Suppose a Japanese people is giving a lecture on English language and a Chinese people also giving a lecture on English language and I am sitting there, but I am not understanding fully his English, his or her English.
1.srt	00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:27.920	Because it is come with the Japanese accent all kind of because if it is not the first language of English is not first language of the Japanese speaker.
1.srt	00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:52.970	Suppose I am seeing a lectures of a our North Indian people or our South Indian people their English is little bit of different from the Bengali even my English may not be 100 percent understand or 100 percent you can say the intelligibility of that English is not that good if you suppose you are a speaker of American English when you listen this English you said this intelligibility of the speech is not that good.
1.srt	00:14:53.690 --> 00:15:07.929	Now, think can I make a device, I am saying in Bengali English and it convert to let us American English, American Accented English.
1.srt	00:15:07.929 --> 00:15:10.389	So, intelligibility of the speech is increased.
1.srt	00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.080	Think about I have developed a systems and I am watch the system in here.
1.srt	00:15:16.429 --> 00:15:23.870	So, when you download the lectures and when you listen them English, accent of the English is converted as per your preference.
1.srt	00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:44.299	So, that kind I am not saying that language transformation, somebody is giving a lecture in English, I am listening in Bengali, I am not saying speech to speech conversion, I am saying simple action conversion that I am speaking in a Bengali accented speech, some American speaker listening it in a American accented speech.
1.srt	00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:53.490	Same things an American speaker giving a lectures in American accented language, I want to listen in Bengali accented language.
1.srt	00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.039	So, those kind of.
1.srt	00:15:54.569 --> 00:15:55.989	tremendous kind of application.
1.srt	00:15:56.799 --> 00:16:01.469	Second language acquisition also there is some application of speech kind of things.
1.srt	00:16:01.469 --> 00:16:12.019	So, even if speech research, I will told that ASR, lot of people are doing research in ASR, automatic speech recognition.
1.srt	00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:24.589	And if you worry about that, there is a HMM model, hidden Markov tool, Krismith model, where people are saying that now people are saying that this model is not sufficient for those language.
1.srt	00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:28.319	which resource is very less resource constant language.
1.srt	00:16:28.699 --> 00:16:35.799	So, what kind of alternative speech technology I can develop which is use the speech science.
1.srt	00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:49.989	So, that I can think about new kind of model like that exploitation of speech prosody in ASR is a much more you can say the serious research which is going on by different group of people are doing it.
1.srt	00:16:55.169 --> 00:17:03.549	So, those kind of lot of speech applications are you can say the thing about in your mind and you have to develop some expertise or some skill on speech itself.
1.srt	00:17:03.699 --> 00:17:14.589	So, that you can think about what kind of algorithm or technology or sub computing algorithm I have to use to do this kind of things.
1.srt	00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:16.949	So, this part I will this.
1.srt	00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:22.829	So, if you see the my course outcome or course objective I have never written the sub computing part.
1.srt	00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:25.029	So, I am not covering on that part.
1.srt	00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.749	So, that part may be covered in the other subject.
1.srt	00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:36.769	Now, since it is introduction class, let us talk about that how human being produce speech.
1.srt	00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:48.479	So, there is a suppose I am giving a lectures, I am producing the speech, but what kind of activity is going on in my body to production of this kind of speech.
1.srt	00:17:49.949 --> 00:17:56.379	So, if you see the slides, you can close look in the slides also, the slides will be shared to you.
1.srt	00:17:57.209 --> 00:18:04.829	That what is happening once I want to speak some message formulation is happening in our mind.
1.srt	00:18:05.969 --> 00:18:16.989	And so what is happening if I want to speak a sentence what I want to say that is created that is come from our mind and that is called message planning.
1.srt	00:18:17.239 --> 00:18:27.329	Once the message planning done then it goes to the language model what kind of language code we should use if it is Bengali then the words will be selected if it is English.
1.srt	00:18:27.699 --> 00:18:29.269	some other words will be selected.
1.srt	00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:36.809	And based on the linguistic that is called linguistic information, linguistic coding it will come to neuro muscular action.
1.srt	00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:42.199	So, that coding has to be executed by a human vocal cord.
1.srt	00:18:42.429 --> 00:18:45.319	So, different kind of muscle has to be activities involved.
1.srt	00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:57.919	So, muscle command that is neuro muscular action command will be generated and that command will goes to the this whole function body and this has a two part one is called source.
1.srt	00:18:58.209 --> 00:19:04.629	and one is called muscular action or acoustic system and to produce the different kind of speech.
1.srt	00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:10.029	So, message planning then the linguistics part.
1.srt	00:19:10.179 --> 00:19:12.839	So, if I explain this one in a block diagram basis.
1.srt	00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:19.249	So, message planning that is the rule of grammar, what kind of word I should say, which is verb.
1.srt	00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:24.049	This is unknowingly without grammar I can produce the speech.
1.srt	00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:28.469	So, grammar is not important to generate the message planning.
1.srt	00:19:28.829 --> 00:19:33.739	The person who does not know the language, he can also speak in the same language.
1.srt	00:19:34.629 --> 00:19:38.549	So, this is although it is a rule of grammar, it is automatic.
1.srt	00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:41.629	So, grammar is not primary criteria.
1.srt	00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:47.909	Grammar is discovered by us to explain the phenomena of what message planning is going on.
1.srt	00:19:48.449 --> 00:19:53.989	So, speech message planning which is lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic.
1.srt	00:19:54.369 --> 00:19:57.939	Then come to the rule of prosody, utterance planning.
1.srt	00:19:58.199 --> 00:20:00.109	How I produce the speech?
1.srt	00:20:00.259 --> 00:20:04.279	I can produce this very excited manner, I can produce the very low manner.
1.srt	00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:05.629	I may be very sad.
1.srt	00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:09.289	So, those kinds of prosody planning will come here, utterance planning.
1.srt	00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:15.019	Then motor command will be generated and speech production system will produce the speech.
1.srt	00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:20.889	If you see in message planning, lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic.
1.srt	00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:29.799	Then if you see the utterance planning, paralinguistic, intention, attitude, stylistic, every human being has a different kind of speech styles.
1.srt	00:20:30.189 --> 00:20:35.169	Then non-linguistic parameters also there, which is common in the motor and utterance planning also.
1.srt	00:20:35.929 --> 00:20:44.739	If you see the physiological problem also there, somebody has a very thick vocal cords and very short kind of things.
1.srt	00:20:44.739 --> 00:20:54.969	So, he can produce a very bias which is very, the fundamental frequency is very low and somebody has a different kind of style of speaking.
1.srt	00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:57.269	Somebody has a stammering problem.
1.srt	00:20:57.439 --> 00:21:03.849	So, all are come from here motor command generation that planning and then the speech is produced.
1.srt	00:21:04.099 --> 00:21:06.129	So, once the speech is produced.
1.srt	00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:11.759	This is radiated either from the mouth or from the nose.
1.srt	00:21:12.979 --> 00:21:19.509	Once I have produced the sound using this vocal cord, if you see there is a vellum inside it, details I will discuss.
1.srt	00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:22.549	And either the vellum will be closed or open.
1.srt	00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:30.119	If vellum is closed, some part of sound will come to the nasal cavity or if the oral cavity is completely closed, so it will come to the nasal cavity.
1.srt	00:21:30.459 --> 00:21:34.329	If the nasal cavity is completely closed, it will come to the oral cavity.
1.srt	00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:35.779	So, it is radiated.
1.srt	00:21:36.199 --> 00:21:38.489	So, acoustics which is generated in here.
1.srt	00:21:38.769 --> 00:21:44.909	It is radiated from our mouth or nose cavity and propagated in a acoustics wave.
1.srt	00:21:45.469 --> 00:21:48.730	That is why it is called speech acoustics and important.
1.srt	00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.759	So speech is produced by a human being.
1.srt	00:21:52.089 --> 00:21:55.349	So the acoustics wave is travel in the medium.
1.srt	00:21:55.709 --> 00:21:59.589	You know that acoustic wave cannot travel without the medium.
1.srt	00:21:59.879 --> 00:22:03.079	So acoustics wave come in the medium and transmitted.
1.srt	00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:14.409	So once the acoustic wave is transmitted, a listener who present to listen that voice, the acoustic wave strike is in ear system.
1.srt	00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:16.379	So, hearing system is there.
1.srt	00:22:16.769 --> 00:22:18.119	So, the acoustic wave is there.
1.srt	00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:24.939	So, now from there the acoustic wave has to be converted to the again neural signal.
1.srt	00:22:25.709 --> 00:22:39.439	Then again neural signal has to be fired the language code and language code from the language code brain decipher the intended meaning or intended message of the.
1.srt	00:22:39.949 --> 00:22:40.339	speaker.
1.srt	00:22:41.079 --> 00:22:49.379	So, listeners is again try to find out what the speaker want to communicate.
1.srt	00:22:50.309 --> 00:23:05.399	Now, if you see this is the process, but this process you can say there is a lot of optimization is possible means that human being has a tradition that in biological system we always conserve the energy.
1.srt	00:23:06.119 --> 00:23:14.949	So, suppose I have speaking to some students and once I see his gesture or once I realize he is tuned with the same topic.
1.srt	00:23:15.449 --> 00:23:28.999	lot of message planning done which is very short or you can say that the planning complete message or complete linguistically complete message is not required to transmit to the listeners.
1.srt	00:23:30.569 --> 00:23:40.939	So, it may not be a linguistically correct sentence or linguistically correct words or whole words I may have not spoken, but listeners understand.
1.srt	00:23:40.939 --> 00:23:46.739	So, once the listeners understand speaker will say that my purpose is.
1.srt	00:23:47.019 --> 00:23:47.399	complete.
1.srt	00:23:47.649 --> 00:23:49.769	So, I do not want to produce the whole sentence.
1.srt	00:23:50.709 --> 00:23:59.959	So, this kind of vulnerability that how this optimization is how this can be tackled in speech science that is also important aspects.
1.srt	00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:03.939	So, this is the speech production and perception mechanism of the human being.
1.srt	00:24:04.229 --> 00:24:06.589	The details I will cover in the following lectures.
1.srt	00:24:07.809 --> 00:24:17.569	Now, if I think about the engineering aspects, so a human being, so if I see the engineering aspect that person speaking.
1.srt	00:24:18.399 --> 00:24:23.139	in the speech or you can say that I have generated the acoustic wave from my mouth.
1.srt	00:24:24.439 --> 00:24:33.919	Now, suppose this acoustic wave I want to transmit from this point to this point and these two points are far away where this acoustic signal cannot reach here.
1.srt	00:24:36.229 --> 00:24:36.789	Have you understand?
1.srt	00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:41.809	Suppose, I am speaking in this room, the persons who are sitting in this room can be audible.
1.srt	00:24:42.229 --> 00:24:46.689	But suppose you are sitting in your home, you want to listen the same acoustic wave.
1.srt	00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:52.969	So, I have to take the help of So, what kind of technology?
1.srt	00:24:53.349 --> 00:24:58.179	So, I have spoken the speaker is radiated the speech in acoustic wave.
1.srt	00:24:59.059 --> 00:25:05.139	Now, I have to use the communication technology which is electrical communication technology.
1.srt	00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:17.079	So, somehow I have to convert this speech acoustical wave to an electrical signal and transmit the electrical signal and this side I have to convert the electrical signal to the acoustics wave.
1.srt	00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:30.719	So, that is why Conversion from acoustic wave to the electrical signal is microphone and conversion from the electrical signal to the acoustic wave is the loudspeaker.
1.srt	00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:41.469	So this is the mechanism I can say that I can transmit the speech from one point to another point.
1.srt	00:25:41.649 --> 00:25:50.919	So now I can deal with this electrical signal whatever the coding technology all kinds of things I can do with this.
1.srt	00:25:51.819 --> 00:25:55.709	That is why I say it is digital speech processing.
1.srt	00:25:55.819 --> 00:25:59.829	I am not saying that the speech processing in analog domain.
1.srt	00:25:59.869 --> 00:26:01.249	I said digital speech processing.
1.srt	00:26:01.509 --> 00:26:11.999	Once I take this electrical signal in digital domain, what kind of processing we should use so that we can develop different kind of technology.
1.srt	00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:18.409	So, if you see this slide, the source of information is the speaker, human speaker.
1.srt	00:26:21.849 --> 00:26:27.879	Then measurement or observation, this acoustic waveform has to be converted to the you can say the acoustic waveform has taken and observation has been done.
1.srt	00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:35.269	Then the signal representation has to be done signal parsing then again human listeners I have to model the human listeners.
1.srt	00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:41.819	So, that now if you see that technology I want to replace this speaker.
1.srt	00:26:42.599 --> 00:26:49.709	So, I say the message planning to acoustic wave generation that has to be done by a machine.
1.srt	00:26:50.489 --> 00:26:52.179	So, I can say it is text.
1.srt	00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:54.779	or idea to acoustic wave.
1.srt	00:26:55.209 --> 00:27:07.999	Here, I want a machine which can convert that the signal which is coming here or acoustic wave to understanding of the speaker's message.
1.srt	00:27:09.089 --> 00:27:15.449	So, this kind it is not yes or I do not say it is automatic speech recognition, here understanding also is a part.
1.srt	00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:20.609	Here also this speaker modeling is not that he just read a text.
1.srt	00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:28.109	Once you talk, you do not read the text, we understand the text and generate that text using a acoustic wave.
1.srt	00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:31.979	So, lot of things are there, I will discuss on that those things.
1.srt	00:27:32.189 --> 00:27:38.749	So, those kind of technology, so either technology should be here, technology should be here or technology should be here.
1.srt	00:27:39.079 --> 00:27:43.139	So, all kinds of speech technology we have to develop.
1.srt	00:27:43.569 --> 00:27:52.189	To develop those kind of technology, we should know what is speech and how it is produced.
1.srt	00:27:52.869 --> 00:27:59.229	Now, if you see, so speech processing is involved different, you can say the dimension or you can say the different discipline.
1.srt	00:27:59.579 --> 00:28:00.999	to work in speech processing.
1.srt	00:28:02.369 --> 00:28:07.019	So, if you say the language communication, so different kind of dimension.
1.srt	00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:27.449	So, speech processing involves algorithm, it is psychoacoustic, room acoustic, speech production, acoustic part, then information theory part, phonetics part, signal processing part, statistical signal processing, entropy, all kind of multidisciplinary action has been involved in developing the speech technology.
1.srt	00:28:29.709 --> 00:28:32.779	I will cover some of the disciplines, not all the disciplines.
1.srt	00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:43.489	So, some of the disciplines I will cover mainly focused on acoustics part of the speech and phonetics, acoustics and phonetics and signal processing part of the speech.
1.srt	00:28:43.739 --> 00:28:45.189	So, thank you.
1.srt	00:28:45.419 --> 00:29:00.639	So, next lectures I will discuss how to record the speech, because before you go to anything on speech processing, you should know how do I record my speech and how do I see it in my laptops or computer.
1.srt	00:29:00.949 --> 00:29:19.449	Whatever I say you can play with it because I say that it is not a theory type of class that I read this class and read this definition and give the exam not this developed and skill after seeing the speech I can able to say this probably the voice signal and it is coming from this region.
1.srt	00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:21.919	So, those kind of expertise I want.
1.srt	00:29:22.379 --> 00:29:22.979	Thank you.
2.srt	00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:16.230	Welcome back.
2.srt	00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.039	So, this lecture is deal with the digitization and recording.
2.srt	00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:51.760	What I will tell you is, before you go to the any speech of this kind of things, you have to have a I should you should familiar how to record the speech many people know that how to record the speech, but at least some ah you can say the skill kind of things I will explain here not details of digitization details of that kind of things I will not clear, but ok some what do you mean by digitization or kind of things I should explain.
2.srt	00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:02.129	So, if you see the normal human hearing is 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz you know that and human speech is 50 hertz to 8 kilo 800 or 8 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.750	and standard phone circuits or telephone speech is 300 hertz to 3 kilohertz or 3.3 kilohertz sometimes say 3.3 kilohertz ok so this is the bandwidth of the human speech normal human speech 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz ok now what i want that i want the digitization of the speech what i said that speech is in acoustic speech whatever the human being is produce that human speech is in acoustic wave.
2.srt	00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:46.680	So, once the human being produce the speech to any kind of speech processing, I should have to digitize the speech because we said the digital speech processing.
2.srt	00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:55.010	So, I say something I have to converted that acoustic wave to digital speech domain.
2.srt	00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.810	First analog signal then analog to digital conversion.
2.srt	00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.569	So, what we do that we use a microphone and amplifier.
2.srt	00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:16.009	amplifier and then microphone amplifier then analog to digital conversion to convert the acoustics wave to a digital signal in this speech.
2.srt	00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.740	So, how do you do that?
2.srt	00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.379	You know that this is the basic theory.
2.srt	00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:27.240	This is called sampling theory that sampling frequency, this is the complete circuits that this is the normal DSP systems.
2.srt	00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.879	So, I can say analog speech do not I am not details with the details of this every blocks.
2.srt	00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.919	So, those are the signal processing domain.
2.srt	00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.830	But, you should know what is there in computer.
2.srt	00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:52.159	So, there is a analog speech which is coming from the microphone may be converted to the going to the NTLizing filter, then sampling hold, then ADC analog to digital conversion, then we do the required signal processing.
2.srt	00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:59.689	Then again if I say the human being human listeners cannot listen that electrical signal.
2.srt	00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.729	Again I have to convert that electrical or digital signal to analog signal and analog signal should be play in a loud speaker.
2.srt	00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.689	to produce the acoustic wave.
2.srt	00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:16.920	Now, sampling frequency analog to digital conversion, sampling frequency is one of the important issue.
2.srt	00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.110	So, basically what it is?
2.srt	00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.719	It is that may be some of you are there who do not know the digital signal passing or analog to digital conversion.
2.srt	00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.290	So, just I explain the very briefly that one.
2.srt	00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.879	So, let us x a t is a time domain signal.
2.srt	00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.480	What do you mean by time domain signal?
2.srt	00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.590	Here is the time and here is the amplitude.
2.srt	00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.219	So, the signal is varying like this way.
2.srt	00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.930	So, that is time domain representation of the signal, analog signal.
2.srt	00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.439	So, analog signal is continuous.
2.srt	00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.189	If you see, it is a continuous signal.
2.srt	00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.060	Now, I want to convert this signal to a digital signal, which is x n. I convert this same signal to an analog digital signal, which is x n. Instead of x t, I convert to x n number.
2.srt	00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.330	What is nothing but a, so digital signal is nothing but a integer number.
2.srt	00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.360	So, how do you do it?
2.srt	00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.189	First, there is a time which is continuous.
2.srt	00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:40.670	I have to convert this time to a some instant with a fixed interval that is delta t. So, I can say that I am taking the x a t as a sample.
2.srt	00:04:40.889 --> 00:05:03.959	or I can think about a switch that suppose this is a switching circuits I there is a x a t is going on I am closing the switch with a frequency with a duration of delta t. So, for this delta t I take the signal then again I have take the signal here I take the signal in here I take the signal in here take the signal in here.
2.srt	00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.969	So, what I am doing I am converting the continuous t with a n t with a duration of delta t.
2.srt	00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:25.759	delta t. So, n delta t. So, n 0 that means here, 1 means here, 2 means here, 3 means here, 4 means here, 5 means here.
2.srt	00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:35.579	So, if I think about the frequency representation of this delta t, 1 by delta t is the frequency.
2.srt	00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.160	What is the frequency of operation of this switch with the frequency is 1 by delta t.
2.srt	00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:59.560	which is nothing but a called F s sampling frequency F s. So, sampling theorem if you see if the there is a sampling theorem this is the sampling theorem which explain this slide I am not saying again and again.
2.srt	00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.139	So, I can say if the sampling theorem say that it is possible to completely recover this signal from this sample signal there is a some rider or some constraint.
2.srt	00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.290	What is those constraints?
2.srt	00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:44.069	It constraints says that if the baseband frequency of this signal is bandwidth is b, baseband or you can say the bandwidth is b means, let the highest frequency component of this signal is f m. If I sample this signal which is f s which must be greater than or equal to 2 f m, this is the rider.
2.srt	00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:56.430	It is possible to recover the signal if it is greater than or equal to twice f m. Why it is greater than or not all time equal to?
2.srt	00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.970	Because let us think about a pure sinusoidal wave.
2.srt	00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:12.520	If it is a pure sinusoidal wave, if it is 2 f, if f s is equal to 2 f m, then all the sample will be here.
2.srt	00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.280	So, I cannot recover the signal.
2.srt	00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:45.200	So, in that case I required F s must be greater than twice F n. So, instead of taking the analog signal, so on the analog signal I am taking some sample instant that is called that how do you take the sample instant multiplying this signal with the sampling frequency impulse signal whose frequency is F s.
2.srt	00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.930	I can say the impulse is there.
2.srt	00:07:49.400 --> 00:08:07.100	When the impulse is present, I take the measurement of the signal that is f s. Now, if you see, if my f s is increases, this gap will be decreases, delta s, delta t will be decreases.
2.srt	00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:10.330	If f s is increases, delta t will be decreases.
2.srt	00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.790	So, if I use the, if my sampling frequency is much much larger, then I can get accurately the signal.
2.srt	00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:35.730	But rider I cannot lowest rider is that f s must be get up then equal to 2 f m, but I can take any sampling frequency.
2.srt	00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.160	So, let us human speech has a 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:50.680	I can take the sampling frequency less 44 kilohertz I can take it which is much above the two times of the which is much above the two times of the.
2.srt	00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.120	20 kilohertz, 44, 40 kilohertz, 44 kilohertz I have taken.
2.srt	00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:05.820	Now if I increase the sampling frequency, I said that I can accurately take the signal.
2.srt	00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:20.610	Now sometime you see although human speech is 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz, we have taken a sampling frequency let us see what is the meaning.
2.srt	00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.880	Meaning is that I am restricted the speech signal, but I am interested the speech signal.
2.srt	00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:34.120	So, if it is 20 kilohertz is sampling frequency, so highest frequency of the speech signal is 8 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:42.270	So, human speech has to be passed to a filter whose highest cutoff frequency is low pass filter is 8 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:53.780	Above 8 kilohertz, all frequency has what down to 0 or you can say discard almost frequency.
2.srt	00:09:54.670 --> 00:10:01.850	So, sampling frequency, based on the sampling frequency you know up to what frequency I can get of this speech signal.
2.srt	00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.460	So, that is the sampling frequency idea.
2.srt	00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.170	So, in speech sometime we use 16 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.940	That means highest frequency component of the signal is 8 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:19.730	If it is 22 kilohertz, then it is 11 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.970	So, that is called sampling frequency.
2.srt	00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.770	Other aspects is quantization.
2.srt	00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:32.960	So, quantization is again I have to what I said I take a take a instant of this value.
2.srt	00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:40.730	This is nothing but a voltage if it is amplitude it is voltage let us pass 5 volt minus 5 volt is here.
2.srt	00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:50.160	So, this voltage has to be converted to a some step if you see here some step.
2.srt	00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.120	So, each step I can represent by a binary number.
2.srt	00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.450	is the binary number.
2.srt	00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:05.770	So, I can say let us that my minus 5 volt to plus 5 volt or I can neatly draw it.
2.srt	00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:19.009	So, that you can understand it that let us I have a signal which varies from minus 5 volt to let us this is minus plus 5 volt and this is minus 5 volt.
2.srt	00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:23.920	So, this whole 10 volt I divided into a some level.
2.srt	00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:41.720	So, how do we decide at the level let us this whole 10 volt is divided in or you can say that I representing this 10 volt by a 8 bit number.
2.srt	00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:51.490	So, what is the highest value of 8 bit 2 to the power 8 8 bit number means integer value is 2 to the power 8.
2.srt	00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.920	So, 2 to the power 8 if it is negative and positive.
2.srt	00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.580	So, 1 bit is goes for sign.
2.srt	00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.210	So, it is minus 127.
2.srt	00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:08.200	So, 2 plus 127 or including 0 it will be 2127.
2.srt	00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.340	I am not saying that part.
2.srt	00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.120	So, making 0 is middle positive and negative.
2.srt	00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:22.230	Minus 127 or 126 you can take it.
2.srt	00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.470	So, 8 bit number.
2.srt	00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:31.270	So now, if I do that then 250 I have divided this 10 volt in 256 levels.
2.srt	00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.960	So, plus side and minus side is there.
2.srt	00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.030	I can divide this thing instead of 8 bit, 16 bit.
2.srt	00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.010	So, 2 to the power 16 level I can divide this thing.
2.srt	00:12:50.460 --> 00:13:01.060	So, once I divided this signal much more smaller gap, the accuracy of the quantization will be increases or quantization error will be decreases.
2.srt	00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.540	I am not detailed discussing about the quantization error because that is there.
2.srt	00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:05.500	quantization error.
2.srt	00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:16.860	So, what I am saying that if I recorded the speech signal with a high quantization, the accuracy or quantization error of the signal is reduced.
2.srt	00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:25.409	So, when I am going for a good quality recording, I should use quantization level should be very high instead of 8 bit.
2.srt	00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:33.820	If I use 12 bit or 16 bit, the quantization error is less, but other aspects is there.
2.srt	00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.029	What is other aspects?
2.srt	00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:40.230	Once I increase the quantization level, what is increasing?
2.srt	00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:47.330	Data size, because if it is 8 bit, one sample is represented by 8 bit.
2.srt	00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.399	If it is 16 bit, single sample is represented by a 16 bit.
2.srt	00:13:55.129 --> 00:14:07.830	Similarly, F s, if it is 8 kilohertz, I can say in one second, I have generated 8 k sample in one second.
2.srt	00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:37.879	I have generated 8 k sample if each sample is represented by 8 bit so for one second speech recording I will get 8 kilo byte 8 bit is 1 byte so 8 kilo byte similarly if I quantize it with 16 bit it will be 16 kilo byte 16 bit is 2 byte so 16 kilo byte so one I increase the quantization level.
2.srt	00:15:10.429 --> 00:15:12.729	although my signal to noise ratio is decreases means increases that means i quantization error is decreases but my memory size is increases similarly once i increase the sampling frequency my accuracy of the digital signal will be increases but what is increases size of the file is increases instead of 8 k if it is 16 k that means in one second i have generate 16 k sample if each sample is 8 bit then 16 kilo byte.
2.srt	00:15:15.329 --> 00:15:21.219	So, there is a trade off what quantization level I should use, what kind of sampling frequency I should use.
2.srt	00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:31.490	So, when you record the speech signal suppose you recording the speech signal for telephone speech which is band width is 300 hertz to 3.3 kilo hertz.
2.srt	00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:40.240	So, if it is my signal is band limited to 3.3 kilo hertz I should not sample this signal with a very high frequency.
2.srt	00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.539	high sampling frequency.
2.srt	00:15:42.789 --> 00:15:50.419	So, my 8 kilohertz is sufficient even if double this thing nearest is 8 kilohertz is sufficient to sample this thing.
2.srt	00:15:50.419 --> 00:16:00.250	So, that is why the telephone bandwidth is 4 if it 8 kilohertz is sampling frequency 4 kilohertz is the maximum frequency which can present in the speech.
2.srt	00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:12.419	So, now I give a problem let us I am not going details of this digitization things let us this is the problem.
2.srt	00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:20.159	An audio signal is recorded using the following format to store 50 millisecond signal in PCM warp format.
2.srt	00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:22.579	How much memory is required?
2.srt	00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:29.459	Sampling frequency is 8 kilohertz encoded with 16 bit recorded in mono channel.
2.srt	00:16:30.459 --> 00:16:38.399	So, if it is 8 kilohertz 8 bit in 1 second it will generate 8 k sample.
2.srt	00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:49.019	So, in 50 millisecond I have to know how much sample it will be generate and for each sample is 1 byte how much memory required I can calculate.
2.srt	00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.250	Similarly, there is another conversion also I have I should taught in here.
2.srt	00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:03.639	Suppose, sometime we said number of sample to time conversion is very important.
2.srt	00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:13.670	Suppose, I have a speech signal, I say a speech signal is sampling frequency is 16 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.849	How much sample will be there within a 20 millisecond signal?
2.srt	00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:24.220	So, in one second there will be a 16 kilo sample.
2.srt	00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:34.730	in 20 millisecond in 1 second into 20, 320 sample.
2.srt	00:17:35.659 --> 00:17:40.659	So, 320 sample represent 20 millisecond.
2.srt	00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:45.389	If it is 8 kilohertz, then how many sample will be there?
2.srt	00:17:45.389 --> 00:17:49.169	Half of this, half of this because it is half of this.
2.srt	00:17:55.259 --> 00:17:59.130	If it is 44 kilohertz, then you can calculate how many samples will be there.
2.srt	00:17:59.509 --> 00:18:01.640	So, instead of 20 second, I can say 30 second.
2.srt	00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.369	So, once I say the window size of 40 millisecond, then you know how much sample will be there.
2.srt	00:18:06.569 --> 00:18:13.380	Similarly, if I say if 320 samples I have taken, time domain representation is 20 millisecond.
2.srt	00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:14.880	I can convert.
2.srt	00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:20.200	This will be frequently used in speech processing.
2.srt	00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.180	Number of sample to time, time to sample.
2.srt	00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:28.009	So, this is the basic idea of digitization of the speech.
2.srt	00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:33.450	Now, there is expertise required, how do I record the speech?
2.srt	00:18:34.069 --> 00:18:44.380	Normal recording is that if you see I have a collar mic connected to a wireless transmitter and there is a sound card and once I talk this mic is converted to electrical signal.
2.srt	00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:56.440	This electrical signal goes to the sound card digitize the sound card is digitize the signal and recorded.
2.srt	00:18:57.779 --> 00:19:13.470	So, microphone there is a amplifier if it is required sometime microphone directly connected to the sound card which contain the amplifier then digital recording device or which convert that analog signal to digital signal then if I want playback.
2.srt	00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.299	So, I require a speaker or headphone this kind of things.
2.srt	00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.130	So, in digital recording what is does it is does the digitization and storing of the sound.
2.srt	00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:39.669	So, digitization means it require the sampling frequency and Also, number of quantization bit and also stereo or mono that I have not discussed details, but most cases in sound recording does in mono.
2.srt	00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:43.869	Since, it is a single channel that I want to record the human voice.
2.srt	00:19:44.159 --> 00:19:50.639	So, when you analyze your voice in computer, you should record the signal in mono format not stereo format.
2.srt	00:19:50.639 --> 00:19:54.549	It is not required because there is no two source are there single source is speaking.
2.srt	00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:58.769	So, it is mono is sufficient same things.
2.srt	00:19:59.139 --> 00:20:00.669	How this is stored in computer?
2.srt	00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:07.460	There is a different kind of file format mono versus stereo that I said stereo means two channel mono means single channel.
2.srt	00:20:07.779 --> 00:20:13.970	Stereo sound I have not explained in detail there is a stereo sound, there is a 5.1 channel sound, there is a Dolby digital sound.
2.srt	00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:27.109	So, Dolby digital is again in one format it is not a sound you can say that it is a sound recording Dolby digital is a sound you can say the compression technique or you can say the sound compression procedure.
2.srt	00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.849	So, Dolby digital is a format instead of WMA, DSS, AU, etc.
2.srt	00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:40.970	So, all are some are coded speech forward, some are non coded because it is just stored the sample.
2.srt	00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.799	So, but if this is the MP3, it is a compressed.
2.srt	00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:50.930	So, sound can be stored either compressed or without compressed.
2.srt	00:20:51.319 --> 00:21:00.279	If I store the signal, let us that in one second it is generate 8 kilo watt, I can compress it and store it and there is no compression.
2.srt	00:21:01.019 --> 00:21:01.370	technique.
2.srt	00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:06.100	And when I want to play the sound, I will decompress the signal and play it in the web.
2.srt	00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:14.070	Similarly, when I process the sound, I should extract the sound sample by sample.
2.srt	00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:22.590	So, if it is a compressed format, store in a compressed format, I have to decompress it and use the sample by sample for processing.
2.srt	00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.670	And again I can compress it.
2.srt	00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:31.910	Now, any audio translation or MP3, MPEG-4, WMA, DSS, and so on.
2.srt	00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.620	there is a loss.
2.srt	00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.520	If we compress the sound, I have lost some sound.
2.srt	00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:44.460	So, I cannot recover those signal those sound once I do the decompose it and process the sound sample by sample.
2.srt	00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:52.360	So, if I want to store the just simple recording in sample by sample, use PCMA warp format.
2.srt	00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:57.140	So, there is a PCMA warp format header file, Microsoft PCMA warp format header file.
2.srt	00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.030	So, I get the sound file, dot warp format.
2.srt	00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:02.810	This is a binary file.
2.srt	00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.120	it contains whole recording of the sound.
2.srt	00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.070	Let us I get this, there is a header.
2.srt	00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:14.490	So, if you see this header, there is a different chunk position has different information.
2.srt	00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.280	So, I have to know what is the sampling frequency of the sound and what is the encoded bit of the sound.
2.srt	00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:25.350	If it is 16 bit, that means 2 byte represent one sample.
2.srt	00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.110	If it is 8 bit, 8 bit represent one sample.
2.srt	00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.780	If it is stereo, all channels are same.
2.srt	00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.170	If it is stereo, there are two channel recording is there.
2.srt	00:22:35.569 --> 00:22:44.519	If it is mono, single channel recording is there and there also sampling frequency is important because unless I do not know the sampling frequency, I cannot process it.
2.srt	00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:50.990	Digital signal or this digital processing of this sound file is required a sampling frequency.
2.srt	00:22:51.319 --> 00:22:59.789	So sampling frequency also stored in this sampling rate, byte rate, block again, block size, so those format details are given in this slide.
2.srt	00:23:06.829 --> 00:23:09.369	So digital format uncompressed and compressed format what I have expressed and then I can go for the microphone selection.
2.srt	00:23:10.609 --> 00:23:15.529	Suppose I want to record, I say you to record your name in your computer.
2.srt	00:23:16.039 --> 00:23:16.909	So, how do you record it?
2.srt	00:23:18.139 --> 00:23:25.509	You may use a headphone and connect it to the computer sound card and you record the sound.
2.srt	00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:36.430	But once the human being produce the speech, its range is 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:43.200	The acoustic wave contain 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz sound.
2.srt	00:23:44.759 --> 00:23:50.670	Once I put the microphone in the front of the mouth, so microphone has a limitation.
2.srt	00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:57.170	Microphone has one property that it has to be convert this acoustic wave to a electrical signal.
2.srt	00:23:57.599 --> 00:23:59.279	So microphone may have a limitation.
2.srt	00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:06.410	So microphone may have a sensitivity, microphone may have a frequency response.
2.srt	00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:16.809	microphone has a pickup pattern all kinds of restrictions are there who know the details of microphone you know that there is a lot of parameters of the microphones are there.
2.srt	00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:29.589	So if you see I am recording a speech with a microphone whose frequency response is may be 100 hertz to 10 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:46.750	So I cannot get the acoustics wave after 10 kilohertz may not be required in human speech, but I cannot get those speech after 10 kilohertz because my microphone has a limitation.
2.srt	00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:55.769	It can only record the signal or you can only transfer the acoustic wave to electrical signal of 100 hertz to 10 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:24:57.039 --> 00:25:03.279	So, if I apply a 12 kilohertz signal, acoustic wave, it may not produce any signal.
2.srt	00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:05.069	It not produce any signal.
2.srt	00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.769	So, I am not getting any information in the electrical wave.
2.srt	00:25:08.059 --> 00:25:11.549	Once that electrical signal I get, I will pass through the digital cut.
2.srt	00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:21.890	So, selection of the microphone frequency response, microphone time, how to connect it all are very important.
2.srt	00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:29.100	So, which microphone I should use, it depends on what kind of application I want to develop.
2.srt	00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:43.860	Suppose, I want to develop a speech coding for telephone channel, then I should not use a very high end microphone which frequency response is 20 kilohertz, because my signal is 4 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.810	band limited.
2.srt	00:25:45.330 --> 00:26:01.360	So, I can use 10 kilohertz sensitivity of a frequency response of a microphone is very good for recording that telephone bandwidth even 5 kilohertz microphone sensitivity up to 5 kilohertz is sufficient for recording the telephone channel signal.
2.srt	00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.820	Now, suppose I want to develop a speech corpus for research purpose.
2.srt	00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.500	If I want that this corpus only used for scientific research.
2.srt	00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:28.930	If I want that that should contain that whole human speech range of frequency, then I should use a very high end microphone whose frequency response may be 15 kilohertz or may be 20 kilohertz.
2.srt	00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.640	So, the microphone then the amplifier is also there.
2.srt	00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:34.000	Amplifier frequency response also important.
2.srt	00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:44.920	So, amplifier and microphone whole frequency response should be higher than the my desired what frequency I want to record that.
2.srt	00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:54.109	And there is a if you know if you know there is a different kind of microphone hand handle microphone head mounted microphone all things are there.
2.srt	00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:59.509	So, all microphones has a there the advantage and disadvantage I am not going details of the microphone.
2.srt	00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:09.220	Then there is a carbon mic piezoelectric mic dynamic mic conditional mic ribbon mic every mic has his own frequency response his own advantage and disadvantage.
2.srt	00:27:09.619 --> 00:27:16.759	Then there is a connector is there then if you see the directivity microphone has may be omnidirectional.
2.srt	00:27:17.119 --> 00:27:24.599	microphone may be bidirectional, may be unidirectional all kinds of directional means which point microphone has a pick up.
2.srt	00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:33.599	That means, if I use this kind of microphone if you see the omnidirectional that means, that can that microphone can pick up from any sound any direction.
2.srt	00:27:33.889 --> 00:27:42.359	If it is a unidirectional that can only pick up a sound from in one direction that is represented in a polar port the slides are there.
2.srt	00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:46.829	This is the frequency response example of a microphone.
2.srt	00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:48.449	the signal is clicked.
2.srt	00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:50.119	What do you mean by clicking?
2.srt	00:27:50.699 --> 00:27:58.829	Now, suppose I have an ADC or volume of the recording volume which is control the ADC level.
2.srt	00:27:59.149 --> 00:28:04.659	So, suppose this is 5 volt to minus 5 volt.
2.srt	00:28:05.339 --> 00:28:09.829	This ADC can handle 5 volt to minus 5 volt.
2.srt	00:28:10.649 --> 00:28:15.679	Now, if I amplify my sound 7 volt to minus 7 volt.
2.srt	00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:20.939	So, suppose 5 volt to minus 5 volt sound wave, sine wave, let us sine wave.
2.srt	00:28:21.209 --> 00:28:22.409	it is very like this.
2.srt	00:28:23.649 --> 00:28:28.709	If my limitation is 5 volt, if I apply 7 volt, so what will happen?
2.srt	00:28:29.129 --> 00:28:31.249	After 5 volt, it will be flat.
2.srt	00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:37.469	So, after 5 volt, it will be flat response.
2.srt	00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:41.489	So, what is if it is flat, what is happening?
2.srt	00:28:42.829 --> 00:28:44.609	So, this portion I am not getting.
2.srt	00:28:45.859 --> 00:28:46.799	I am getting a flat.
2.srt	00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:51.269	So, if it is cleft, that means it developed a square wave.
2.srt	00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:52.419	there.
2.srt	00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:57.919	So, original frequency component of this signal I cannot get it.
2.srt	00:28:58.659 --> 00:29:03.799	I get the square wave content all the frequency all the frequency content.
2.srt	00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:16.019	So, this kind of recording if you record the signal which is clipped then if it is clipped then your whole recording purpose is gone.
2.srt	00:29:19.329 --> 00:29:26.069	Your whole recording purpose is because it is developed lot of sound frequency also.
2.srt	00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:33.109	So, be sure the signal is not clipped, recording label is not clipped.
2.srt	00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:56.439	And environmental noise is very important and there is a free software tools for recording, there is a speech tools, I have used cool edit pro, I have used web surfer, prat all you can use any software you can use or I can you just go to the google and type prat it will prat will be downloaded and store it.
2.srt	00:29:57.669 --> 00:30:12.119	Now, what session I will what home talks or you can say what practice I can given that use this recording procedure and record your name let us 5 times record your name in 5 times.
2.srt	00:30:12.329 --> 00:30:18.849	So, that the signal is not clipped and see the highest frequency content of your signal.
2.srt	00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:28.449	Next class I will show you using this software how to see the highest frequency content of the signal all those kind of thing and see the how much size it is taken.
2.srt	00:30:28.989 --> 00:30:40.159	Then think about that if I told you cut a window of this sample, this number sample to this number sample, how do you do that in a programming also very important.
2.srt	00:30:40.599 --> 00:30:42.019	So, those things you just practice.
2.srt	00:30:42.369 --> 00:30:42.999	Thank you.
3.srt	00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.150	.
3.srt	00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:30.320	So, before we start digital speech processing some ah signal processing concept has to be reviewed because those will be used frequently in many places.
3.srt	00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.840	So, you may find difficulty the to conceptualize those DSP problem.
3.srt	00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:50.159	So, what I do that I will just review some DSP concept, but details I will not go because details this is a separate subject which is called digital signal parsing because this is the best point of knowing the digital speech parsing.
3.srt	00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:07.280	So, whatever the acoustic phonetics speech production you know that is different because that does not require any DSP concept that much, but once I explain start that explaining the digital speech processing and modeling discrete modeling discrete time modeling.
3.srt	00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.430	So, in that cases some DSP concept is required.
3.srt	00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.590	So, I just quickly go through the some DSP concept.
3.srt	00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.400	So, what I will discuss I am not discuss the details mathematics I will discuss concept behind that DSP algorithm ok.
3.srt	00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:24.909	So, let us start with that continuous signal.
3.srt	00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.489	So, if I if you know that this omega always represent that continuous frequency this omega ok.
3.srt	00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:41.319	So, if I say sinusoidal signal let us say A is the amplitude cos omega t plus theta theta is the phase.
3.srt	00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.230	ok.
3.srt	00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.740	So, this omega is continuous frequency ok. Now, what are the property?
3.srt	00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:55.090	If you change this the frequency at this things if it is 500 hertz sinusoidal then it a frequency is 500 hertz.
3.srt	00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.520	If you increase the frequency in time domain suppose if it is if it is like this.
3.srt	00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.490	So, what you say ok this has an oscillation.
3.srt	00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.030	So, the number of period in per second give me the frequency ok.
3.srt	00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.620	So, this there is a oscillation is there.
3.srt	00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.270	Now, if I increase the frequency what will happen?
3.srt	00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.099	means the number of oscillations or number of period per second will be increases.
3.srt	00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.960	So, high frequency means oscillations will be increases.
3.srt	00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.210	So, that is the property.
3.srt	00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.090	So, more period are included in one second, more period are included in time.
3.srt	00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.340	So, this is the low frequency and this is the high frequency signal.
3.srt	00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.280	So, this is the concept of analog signal.
3.srt	00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.040	Now, once I make the digital signal, let us this cos omega t I sampled and stored it is a digital signal.
3.srt	00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.240	So, if it is a continuous if x at is a continuous signal.
3.srt	00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.540	then what should be the x n?
3.srt	00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.770	x n is a digital signal.
3.srt	00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:59.150	So, x n is nothing but a cos instead of continuous omega we write this omega n plus theta.
3.srt	00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.770	This is called discrete frequency.
3.srt	00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:14.129	So, this is continuous radian per second and this is that this is this is this frequency is per sample I will come details I will come.
3.srt	00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.990	So, this is written like this way.
3.srt	00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.730	And what is the property?
3.srt	00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.870	Now, a discrete time signal is periodic if its frequency f is rational number.
3.srt	00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.170	What do you understand?
3.srt	00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.440	What is where the small f is come?
3.srt	00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.810	Now, what is omega?
3.srt	00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.820	Omega is nothing but a 2 pi f. Now, if it is digitized signal what I have done?
3.srt	00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:47.970	I have replaced this t by n into capital T. So, this omega continuous frequency omega is nothing but a 2 pi f.
3.srt	00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.030	So, this frequency is continuous frequency.
3.srt	00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:49.399	Now, once I make it discrete frequency then omega is equal to 2 pi f, but this t is replaced by n t. So, this omega n becomes omega n is nothing but a 2 pi f into n into t. So, it is nothing but a 2 pi f into n divided by f s. So, if the frequency content let us I write this one, this frequency of this cos this digital signal is 500 R. So, let us this is denoted by F. So, this denoted by capital F. So, F by F s small f is nothing but a frequency of the signal that is analog frequency divided by F s. So, I cannot say that this is a if it is periodic if this is a rational number then only it will be periodic.
3.srt	00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:53.329	I am not discussing the number system, what is the rational number.
3.srt	00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:01.779	And then discrete time sinusoidal whose frequency are separated by integer multiple of 2 pi are identical.
3.srt	00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:09.689	Very simple, if the cos is a distinct sinusoidal, if it is integer multiple of 2 pi separated then they are identical.
3.srt	00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.800	So, 2 pi is the maximum period.
3.srt	00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.129	So, the highest rate of oscillation, the highest value of small m, what is the highest value of small m?
3.srt	00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:36.240	So, f is equal to f by f s. So, what is f s as per sampling theorem f s should be at least twice f. So, I can say f by 2 f. So, it is half.
3.srt	00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.120	So, in continuous frequency omega can varies from minus infinity to plus infinity.
3.srt	00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:53.769	But if you see this small f can varies from minus half.
3.srt	00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:01.629	half to plus half minus half to plus half.
3.srt	00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:11.069	So, if it is F s if I say that 2 pi capital F is the analog frequency.
3.srt	00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.080	So, is a continuous signal omega is radian per second and this omega is radian per sample.
3.srt	00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.550	So, this can varies from minus infinity to plus infinity.
3.srt	00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.639	So, this frequency also can varies from minus infinity to plus infinity.
3.srt	00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:32.680	but if you see small f can varies only minus half to plus half and small omega what is the value of omega?
3.srt	00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.910	Omega is nothing but a 2 pi f. So, f is nothing but a minus f minus half to plus half.
3.srt	00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:51.320	So, I can say omega can vary only from minus pi to plus pi where f is the sampling frequency.
3.srt	00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.570	So, small omega represent the discrete frequency.
3.srt	00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.240	frequency and capital omega represent analog frequency.
3.srt	00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:10.610	This is radian per second, this is radian per sample, radian per sample and this is radian per second.
3.srt	00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:17.670	So, if I say this sometime this omega is called also normalized frequency.
3.srt	00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:25.570	So, if I say I have a signal whose capital F is 50 kilohertz and less than.
3.srt	00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:28.020	sampling frequency is 100 kilohertz.
3.srt	00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.780	So, what is the value of omega?
3.srt	00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:44.080	Omega is nothing but a 2 pi f, where it is 2 pi f by f s. So, it is nothing but a 2 pi 50 divided by 100.
3.srt	00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.490	So, it is nothing but a pi.
3.srt	00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.200	It is nothing but a pi.
3.srt	00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:05.750	Now, if it is 40 kilohertz, it is nothing Then, it is 2 pi f into f by f s. So, it is nothing but a 2 pi 40 by 100.
3.srt	00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.649	So, it is 4 by 5 pi normalized discrete frequency.
3.srt	00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.970	So, this omega is called discrete frequency.
3.srt	00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.779	This concept is very important.
3.srt	00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:21.829	This will be used in many ways.
3.srt	00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:26.259	So, this omega continuous, this is discrete.
3.srt	00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:32.360	this is radian per second, this is radian per sample.
3.srt	00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.500	Next concept is complex signal.
3.srt	00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:48.570	A complex it is known everybody knows that complex signal, however, is a vector everybody knows a complex vector or complex signal has an amplitude and has an phase.
3.srt	00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:57.820	So, I can say if I A plus j B is a complex number, it can be written as r e to the power j theta.
3.srt	00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:08.110	where r is nothing but a root over of a square plus b square and theta is nothing but a tan inverse b by a, same thing say complex signal.
3.srt	00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:14.799	Now, I come to the impulse representation.
3.srt	00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:27.970	So, suppose this is given x n is represented by x k and delta function, so n minus k. So, if I say this my P n is like this.
3.srt	00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:47.590	Let us P n is my digital signal P n is a 3 delta n plus 3 plus a 1 delta n minus 1 plus a 2 let us delta n minus 2.
3.srt	00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:53.090	So, this del a 3 a 1 are the coefficient and those are the delta position.
3.srt	00:09:53.409 --> 00:09:59.549	So, at that position the signal has amplitude a 3 sample has amplitude a 3 at that position.
3.srt	00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.390	signal has amplitude a 1.
3.srt	00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.970	So, that can be represented like this way because it is plus 3.
3.srt	00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:16.740	So, minus 3 point there will be a sample whose coefficient amplitude is minus a 3 that is a sample at first sample position 1 2 like that way it is represented.
3.srt	00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.129	So, this is the impulse representation of a sequence.
3.srt	00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:27.190	So, if I say I have a speech signal x n who has suppose there is a 100 sample.
3.srt	00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.680	Now, if I say the sample start from 0 1 to 100.
3.srt	00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:43.430	So, Then, first sample is nothing but A, the amplitude less, first sample amplitude is A 1 with delta n plus n minus 0 is 0.
3.srt	00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.590	Next, A 2 delta n minus 1, like that way I can write.
3.srt	00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.110	So, that will be used in different time when you process the digital signal.
3.srt	00:10:55.270 --> 00:11:09.980	Now, next concept is classification of signal, different type of signal, energy signal, power signal I am not describing, you know that if it is energy infinite then call energy signal, if power is finite then it is called.
3.srt	00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:10.860	signal.
3.srt	00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:19.029	Periodic signal, aperiodic signal, a signal is periodic if it is repeat its nature after certain time interval in time domain.
3.srt	00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:26.330	If it is repeat in nature let us after n sample then I can say the n sample is the period of the signal.
3.srt	00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:38.450	So, x n is periodic with period n if and only if x n plus n is equal to x n. So, why the periodicity?
3.srt	00:11:39.019 --> 00:11:45.100	If this point and next repeating point is same then I can say the signal is repeat itself.
3.srt	00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:45.980	So, it is a period.
3.srt	00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:58.940	So, digital signal x if n is the period then x of n plus small n plus capital N is equal to x n then you call signal is periodic.
3.srt	00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:17.970	Then symmetric and anti symmetric signal a real valued signal x n is called symmetric if x of minus n is equal to x n. On the other hand if it is anti symmetric then x of minus n will be minus x n. So, this is the signal property.
3.srt	00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.470	Next, discrete time system.
3.srt	00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:36.009	So, some signal periodic, aperiodic, signal symmetric, anti-symmetric, I have not discussed signal is called stationary and non-stationary signal is also.
3.srt	00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:37.700	So, what do you mean by stationary signal?
3.srt	00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:45.679	If the signal does not change its property over the time, then I can say it is a stationary signal.
3.srt	00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:50.730	Suppose, I have a sinusoidal of 500 hertz.
3.srt	00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:52.659	Let this is a 500 hertz sinusoidal.
3.srt	00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:59.980	If I take this time, if I take this time, all the time it is 500 hertz sinusoidal.
3.srt	00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.389	So, I can say the signal is a stationary signal.
3.srt	00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:07.559	It does not change its property along the time.
3.srt	00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.320	Now, say the speech signal.
3.srt	00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:15.750	If I say speech signal, if I say a sentence along the time, the signal properties varies.
3.srt	00:13:15.909 --> 00:13:20.830	Sometime it is silent, sometime it is voice, sometime it is silent, sometime it is friction.
3.srt	00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:23.889	then may be silence, then may be voice.
3.srt	00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:27.690	So, I can say along the time signal changes its property.
3.srt	00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:30.480	So, it is a time varying signal.
3.srt	00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:37.860	Later on you learn that signal parsing algorithms are applied on a stationary signal.
3.srt	00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:42.840	So, I have to consider how I make the speech signal is non stationary.
3.srt	00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:45.970	So, those kind of consideration we will take.
3.srt	00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.690	So, this is stationary and non stationary signal.
3.srt	00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:51.669	Then I come to the systems.
3.srt	00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.550	If you call system, this is called discrete systems.
3.srt	00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.100	I am not going to the analog system.
3.srt	00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.110	You know the signals and systems that class.
3.srt	00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:14.480	So, discrete system, let us output of a discrete system is Y n is nothing but a H of input X n. So, H is the transfer function of the systems.
3.srt	00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:21.750	Let us the system is like this Y n is equal to 0.8 Y n minus 1.
3.srt	00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:31.679	plus 0.5 x n plus 0.9 x n minus 1.
3.srt	00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:36.600	So, if I told you draw the system diagram, digital system diagram.
3.srt	00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:52.490	So, I can say what is y n minus 1 means the y n is delayed by sample number 1, the sample number 1 sample n minus 1 means 1 sample delay x n minus 1 means input is 1 sample delay.
3.srt	00:14:53.579 --> 00:15:07.500	So, if this is my x n, let this is my x n. So, x n has to be multiplied with amplitude 0.5 and has to be added with 0.9 multiplied x n minus 1.
3.srt	00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:15.259	So, I can say let us I take one x n in here input and apply a z to the power minus 1 delay.
3.srt	00:15:15.259 --> 00:15:22.299	z to the power minus 1 represent one sample delay and added with this signal with a amplitude of 0.9.
3.srt	00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:32.620	So, output is nothing but a 0.5 x of n plus 0.9 x of n minus 1.
3.srt	00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:45.919	Now, let us this is my y n. So, y n is nothing but a this plus there is a y n minus 1.
3.srt	00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:54.299	So, I can take one input from here and then z to the power minus 1 delay apply and added with it with a multiplication factor.
3.srt	00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.450	So, this is my system diagram.
3.srt	00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:12.509	So, this is y n and this is x n. So, signal flow is this way sorry this way this way or not.
3.srt	00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.990	So, discrete system can be implemented like this way.
3.srt	00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.360	So, z to the power minus 1 is nothing but a single sample display.
3.srt	00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.210	Now, a system consists of certain properties.
3.srt	00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:28.289	I will come implementation later on also.
3.srt	00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.449	A system has certain property.
3.srt	00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.689	What are the property?
3.srt	00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:36.860	It is may be statics or it may be dynamic system.
3.srt	00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:51.389	A discrete system is called statics or memoryless if its output at any instant n depend at most on the input sample at the same time, but not past or future sample of the input.
3.srt	00:16:52.799 --> 00:17:01.149	So, suppose my y n is only depends on x n and x n minus y n.
3.srt	00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:08.750	1, but not x n plus 1, then I can say my system is static.
3.srt	00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:19.939	So, our memory less system and if it is future sample, then I can say it is with memory system.
3.srt	00:17:21.889 --> 00:17:26.629	So, memory less system, static system with memory system is dynamic system.
3.srt	00:17:27.149 --> 00:17:32.949	Then time invariant and time variant system, time invariant and time variant signal.
3.srt	00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:40.259	that is called stationary and non stationary signal, but if it is time variant and time invariant system.
3.srt	00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:48.579	So, if the system does not change its property over the time then I call it is a time invariant system.
3.srt	00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:54.880	If it is change along with the time then I can say it is a time variant system.
3.srt	00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:01.109	If I consider this vocal tract is a system along the time it change its construction.
3.srt	00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.000	So, it is a time varying system.
3.srt	00:18:04.269 --> 00:18:11.990	suppose x is suppose operator square always it will be square whatever the input will come it will square.
3.srt	00:18:12.019 --> 00:18:15.069	So, property does not change along with the time.
3.srt	00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:18.589	So, it is a time invariant system.
3.srt	00:18:35.399 --> 00:18:46.000	So, how do you mathematically say that if it is x n is the input of a system H and output is y n. If I apply x n minus k I should get the y n minus k then it is called time invariant system along the time system does not change its property.
3.srt	00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:57.269	Now, linear and non-linear system so how do test the linearity of the system the system is linear if it is suppose the superposition principle.
3.srt	00:18:57.269 --> 00:19:05.240	So, what is superposition principle if you know that if I apply two input x 1 plus x 2 n.
3.srt	00:19:06.849 --> 00:19:14.579	to a system h, whatever output I will get this will be same if I apply two input individually.
3.srt	00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:35.819	Let us put a factor a 1 and a 2, this a 1 x 1 n plus h of a 2 x 2 n. So, if it is support a superposition principle then I say the system is a linear system.
3.srt	00:19:36.389 --> 00:19:51.289	So, if the system is linear and time invariant, then we called LTI system, linear time invariant system, that is called LTI system.
3.srt	00:19:51.369 --> 00:19:57.899	That means, the system is linear, system does not change its property along the time.
3.srt	00:19:59.149 --> 00:20:01.449	Then you know causal and non-causal system.
3.srt	00:20:01.449 --> 00:20:06.029	So, if it is not depends on the future, then I call system is a causal system.
3.srt	00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:11.189	Means, Y n is only depends on either X n or X n minus 1.
3.srt	00:20:11.729 --> 00:20:13.979	but not the future input.
3.srt	00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:16.059	Future input will be x n plus 1.
3.srt	00:20:17.139 --> 00:20:20.959	If it is not depend on x n plus 1, then I call it is a causal system.
3.srt	00:20:21.209 --> 00:20:23.019	If it is depend, then it is a non-causal system.
3.srt	00:20:23.019 --> 00:20:25.519	Then stable system, unstable system.
3.srt	00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:26.299	What is stability?
3.srt	00:20:26.299 --> 00:20:32.329	If I apply a bounded input to input to the system, it should produce bounded output.
3.srt	00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:42.259	If I apply a bounded input, if the system produce bounded output, then I call system is stable system, B I B O.
3.srt	00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:45.299	bounded input, bounded output.
3.srt	00:20:45.729 --> 00:20:53.549	In bounded input should produce bounded output, then stable and unstable system.
3.srt	00:20:54.759 --> 00:21:01.929	Then there is recursive and non recursive system that you know that this slide is self exclamatory that explaining that recursive.
3.srt	00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:07.859	If the output depends on the previous output then you call it is a recursive system.
3.srt	00:21:08.939 --> 00:21:13.649	I am not describing details then very much.
3.srt	00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:21.809	or you can say the most commonly used signal processing algorithm in speech is called convolution.
3.srt	00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:28.029	So convolution is the most frequently used.
3.srt	00:21:28.139 --> 00:21:38.979	If you see that if I want to find out a output for a input in a system, then the system transfer function is convolved with the input to produce the output of the system.
3.srt	00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:44.579	So, convolution is most commonly used algorithm in DSP.
3.srt	00:21:45.949 --> 00:21:53.739	So, suppose Yn is produced using a system property Hn convolved with input Xn.
3.srt	00:21:54.089 --> 00:22:01.409	So, how the mathematically it is written?
3.srt	00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:16.399	It is k equal to minus infinity to infinity H of k into X of n minus k. So, Yn is equal to H of k into Xn minus k.
3.srt	00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:27.729	of Y n. So, convolution means that suppose this is my system and I apply a signal here.
3.srt	00:22:28.489 --> 00:22:40.669	So, output is the property of the system must be convolved or modify the input signal produce the output ok.
3.srt	00:22:48.479 --> 00:22:51.499	So, each property of the you can say that whole property of the system should modify the each input of the signal.
3.srt	00:22:51.829 --> 00:22:55.559	So, that is why whole h k will modify the each input.
3.srt	00:22:58.129 --> 00:22:59.989	So, this is convolution.
3.srt	00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:00.909	How it is done?
3.srt	00:23:01.989 --> 00:23:05.609	It has a operation or how many operation is involved?
3.srt	00:23:05.949 --> 00:23:10.879	It is folding, shifting, multiplication and summation.
3.srt	00:23:10.999 --> 00:23:14.149	If you look at this equation, this is nothing but a folding.
3.srt	00:23:14.679 --> 00:23:19.809	So, if I say x n equal to y equal to 0, then it is nothing but a h k.
3.srt	00:23:20.229 --> 00:23:35.899	multiply x minus k. So, I can say the x k is folded to produce x minus k. So, I can give you an example.
3.srt	00:23:36.399 --> 00:23:41.239	So, this is my signal and this has to be convolved with this.
3.srt	00:23:41.489 --> 00:23:43.939	So, green is the let us the system.
3.srt	00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:49.159	So, sorry there is a wrong interpretation you can say that this is h and this is x.
3.srt	00:23:50.579 --> 00:23:53.139	same things consider this is H and this is X.
3.srt	00:23:53.569 --> 00:24:05.509	So, I can say this H is convolved or you can say the X property of X is convolved with H T. So, what I said that H has to be shifted a folded.
3.srt	00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:20.699	So, Y T is means H has to be folded first, then shifting T equal to 0, then product and sum this sample product with this sample.
3.srt	00:24:20.949 --> 00:24:34.009	produce sample then shift the single end by t equal to 1 then again product and sum then again t equal to 2 product and sum then again one sample shift product and sum.
3.srt	00:24:34.129 --> 00:24:35.649	So, that way output will be produced.
3.srt	00:24:36.169 --> 00:24:37.159	Let us give an example.
3.srt	00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:52.089	Let us x n, x n is nothing but instead of writing that way let us 1, 1, 1 and here let us this is 0.
3.srt	00:24:52.609 --> 00:25:07.409	0 1 2 3 and let us h n is nothing but a 1 1 1 and here I am not giving the same example which is in the slide these are two signal.
3.srt	00:25:08.939 --> 00:25:22.979	So, what is there h n so x n let us I want to produce y n which is nothing but a summation sorry summation of k equal to minus infinity into infinity h.
3.srt	00:25:23.169 --> 00:25:30.389	k multiply by x of n minus k. So, which signal has to be folded?
3.srt	00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:41.909	X n. So, I can fold the x n. So, if I draw in pictogram, so this is x n first sample, second sample, third sample, fourth sample.
3.srt	00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:47.999	So, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3.
3.srt	00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:54.729	So, if I want to fold it, so it will be this side 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3.
3.srt	00:25:55.609 --> 00:26:03.519	1, 2, 3 and if I want to plot H n it is nothing but a 1, 2, 3.
3.srt	00:26:05.139 --> 00:26:10.129	So, my Y n first I fold it multiply by 0.
3.srt	00:26:10.129 --> 00:26:15.579	So, Y 0 is nothing but a multiply by this or this with this.
3.srt	00:26:15.829 --> 00:26:21.699	So, 1 multiply by 1 and this with multiply by this 0.
3.srt	00:26:21.699 --> 00:26:25.289	So, this is 0, this is 0, this is also 0.
3.srt	00:26:25.499 --> 00:26:43.139	So, 0, this is 0, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, this is y n, I will draw facelift, so it will be just, let draw it neatly, so use this pen.
3.srt	00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:11.039	So, this is my x of n, sample number 1, sample number 1, 2, 3 and 4 and this is my H n H n is nothing but a sample number 1, sample number 2, sample number 3 sample is there.
3.srt	00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:17.569	Now, what I said to produce the convolution, let us I draw the first.
3.srt	00:27:18.619 --> 00:27:22.739	So, produce the convolution X n has to be folded.
3.srt	00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:28.899	So, I folded X n I will draw here to here this is number 1.
3.srt	00:27:29.399 --> 00:27:54.219	is this side 2 3 4 I folded it and so this is x of minus k. Now, I use the h k, h k is nothing but a 1 1 second sample third sample.
3.srt	00:27:54.319 --> 00:27:55.399	So, this is h k.
3.srt	00:28:00.239 --> 00:28:01.659	Now, what is my y?
3.srt	00:28:01.939 --> 00:28:21.309	So, this is less y n. So, at y 0, y 0 this multiply this and if I say this side if I projected this side it is 0, here it is also 0, here it is also 0, here it is 0.
3.srt	00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:22.909	So, here also it is 0.
3.srt	00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:30.549	So, product this multiply with this, sum with this multiply with this, sum with this will multiply with this.
3.srt	00:28:30.889 --> 00:28:43.289	So, 0 into 1 plus 0 into 1 plus 0 into 1 plus 1 into 1 plus 0 1 into 0 like that way it will come.
3.srt	00:28:44.109 --> 00:28:48.169	This will multiply with this add add and so I can get first sample y.
3.srt	00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:55.579	To get the second yn what I will do instead of doing here I shifted this signal one sample.
3.srt	00:28:56.019 --> 00:29:02.219	So, what I can say let us see this will be one first sample this is the second sample.
3.srt	00:29:02.619 --> 00:29:05.809	this will be third sample 1 2 3 4.
3.srt	00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:08.949	So, this sample again become 0.
3.srt	00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:27.949	Now, I product this will this, this will this, this will this, this will this, this will this, this will this and add together and get the Y n. So, that way I get whole Y n. So, that is why I am holding shifting product and sum.
3.srt	00:29:29.109 --> 00:29:29.769	So, convolution.
3.srt	00:29:30.919 --> 00:29:33.299	Then there is a term called circular convolution.
3.srt	00:29:33.809 --> 00:29:44.339	Circular convolution of x n and h n is defined as the convolution of h n with a periodic signal x p n. If the signal is periodic then I can do a circular convolution.
3.srt	00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:50.249	So, this is the mathematics I am not going details of the circular convolution.
3.srt	00:29:51.299 --> 00:29:55.669	Next correlation, correlation is similar mathematics with the convolution.
3.srt	00:29:56.579 --> 00:29:57.219	What I want?
3.srt	00:29:57.529 --> 00:30:03.869	Suppose I want to find out there is a signal like this and there is a signal like this.
3.srt	00:30:06.019 --> 00:30:09.039	I want to find out whether they are similar or not.
3.srt	00:30:09.819 --> 00:30:11.759	That is why it is called correlation.
3.srt	00:30:12.489 --> 00:30:27.399	Relation between let this is x n and this is y n or you can let us say this is x 1 n. So, correlation between x n and x 1 n is nothing but a similarity between these two signal.
3.srt	00:30:27.849 --> 00:30:28.669	How do I find out?
3.srt	00:30:29.049 --> 00:30:30.949	I just take the, so it is a digital signal.
3.srt	00:30:30.949 --> 00:30:32.389	So, I take the sample by sample.
3.srt	00:30:33.209 --> 00:30:34.629	I take the sample by sample.
3.srt	00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:43.199	So, I can say that I can multiply the two sample and then take the sum product and sum is the correlation.
3.srt	00:30:43.529 --> 00:31:05.969	So, I can say the first correlation coefficient or I can say lth correlation coefficient R L is nothing but a product and sum n equal to minus infinity to infinity x n with x 1 n minus L or x n with n plus L x 1 n plus L.
3.srt	00:31:06.179 --> 00:31:11.969	it is does not matter whether I shifted the signal this way or this way both will give me the correlation.
3.srt	00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:22.749	So, this is the lth correlation if it is zeroth coefficient then I start from zero sample to zero sample if it is fifth sample then I shifted this signal this side fifth sample.
3.srt	00:31:22.749 --> 00:31:26.649	So, start with this this portion of the signal will be not used.
3.srt	00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:33.009	So, I will compare this portion signal with this whole signal understand.
3.srt	00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:37.889	Then if I l equal to 10 then let us this is the 10th sample.
3.srt	00:31:38.069 --> 00:31:42.809	So, this portion of the signal is deducted and I compare this portion with whole signal.
3.srt	00:31:43.749 --> 00:31:45.399	So, that is the correlation.
3.srt	00:31:46.019 --> 00:31:51.869	So, details there may be a detailed discussion in signal passing books you can refer to the any signal passing book.
3.srt	00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:58.739	The algorithm also I have written down you can go through the slides and find out that things then the convolution correlation.
3.srt	00:31:59.539 --> 00:32:07.849	So, then LTI discrete time system which has to consider because in signal passing or speech digital speech passing.
3.srt	00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:26.369	We consider the production system is an LTI system discrete time linear time invariant discrete system LTI discrete system linear time invariant linear system is linear system is time invariant and a discrete system.
3.srt	00:32:26.369 --> 00:32:35.799	So, linearity you know time invariant know and LTI impulse response is direct convolution I am not going details.
3.srt	00:32:36.439 --> 00:32:40.159	Then why I take that LTI system because easy to understand.
3.srt	00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:57.709	it is easy to manipulate powerful processing capability characterized completely by their response to unit sample by a convolutional relationship basis of linear filtering use model for speech production use as a model for speech production.
3.srt	00:32:58.149 --> 00:33:09.879	So, always we try to model this one in a LTI system because it is easy to understand signal processing respect it is easy to understand it is easy to manipulate it powerful processing capability.
3.srt	00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:16.409	So, that is why we always use LTI system linear time invariant system.
3.srt	00:33:16.719 --> 00:33:23.079	So, we want to make this model as a LTI system linear time invariant system.
3.srt	00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:40.309	Now, if you this is the same signal sense system you already you have read it if the x n is the input h 1 and h 2 are the two system function the transfer function and y n is the output then it is a it is commutative the h 2 can be first and h 1 can be second also.
3.srt	00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:42.539	So, all those property you know that.
3.srt	00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:45.689	this is parallel I can shift it here and here.
3.srt	00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:51.119	So, I can plus it or I can star it.
3.srt	00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:57.679	So, this is review of the system property then I can ask you the draw the is the transfer function of this one.
3.srt	00:33:58.489 --> 00:34:09.419	So, these two are parallel this is series with these two system and then again this this the whole transfer function will be parallel you can practice it.
3.srt	00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:13.469	Now implementation is important.
3.srt	00:34:14.369 --> 00:34:17.089	So, how do we implement a discrete system?
3.srt	00:34:18.259 --> 00:34:20.079	There are two kinds of implementation.
3.srt	00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:25.149	One is called direct form 1 and one is called direct form 2.
3.srt	00:34:26.049 --> 00:34:30.489	So, one is called structure 1 implementation and another is called structure 2 implementation.
3.srt	00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:43.629	So, what I said suppose y n is nothing but a a 1 y n minus 1 plus a let us b 1 x of n.
3.srt	00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:47.089	this is my system this can be a system.
3.srt	00:34:47.489 --> 00:35:13.839	So, I can write down the system this is my x n input and I can say that x n n minus 1 let us it is n minus 1 plus let us c 1 into x n. So, I can say this is multiplied by c 1 added with a delay sample z to the power minus 1.
3.srt	00:35:14.439 --> 00:35:35.259	1 and multiply by b 1 then output is y n is nothing but a delay sample which is z to the power minus 1 y n minus 1 multiply by a 1 this is multiply by a 1 added with this input.
3.srt	00:35:36.219 --> 00:35:37.739	So, this is the implementation of that system.
3.srt	00:35:39.689 --> 00:35:44.469	Now, I said that if a system has let us this is my input x n.
3.srt	00:35:44.849 --> 00:36:01.459	and a system had H 1, then I have another system called H 2, let us say this is H 2 and this is Y n, then I can interchange these two systems, H 2 can be here and H 1 can be here, does not does not effect that output.
3.srt	00:36:01.679 --> 00:36:08.529	So, I can say I can change this side to this side and this side to this side, so I invert that one.
3.srt	00:36:08.779 --> 00:36:14.149	So, I can say X n inverting it.
3.srt	00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:44.919	So, I can say x n plus this one is coming this side plus a 1 z to the power minus 1, then this side coming this side z to the power minus 1 plus b 1.
3.srt	00:36:44.919 --> 00:36:46.279	So, this is c 1 will be there.
3.srt	00:36:50.609 --> 00:37:00.259	So, this is called direct form 1, because there is a required 2 memory, 2 delay are separate input delay and output delay are separate.
3.srt	00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:03.319	If I implement this way, then this signal is same.
3.srt	00:37:03.789 --> 00:37:16.309	So, I can say instead of 2 delay, I can replicate it by a single delay z to the power minus 1 multiply a 1 and z to the power minus 1 multiply by b 1.
3.srt	00:37:16.669 --> 00:37:24.519	1 and this is C 1 will be there x n input y n output.
3.srt	00:37:26.029 --> 00:37:32.289	So, this is the advantage this is called direct form 1 and this is called direct form 2 implementation.
3.srt	00:37:33.619 --> 00:37:42.649	So, DSP book it is there this is I said that n long this is one block and this is block once you interchange it will come same side.
3.srt	00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:48.059	So, instead of 2 z to the power delay I can club together and put a single delay.
3.srt	00:37:48.439 --> 00:37:52.779	So, it is called direct form 2 implementation.
3.srt	00:37:53.029 --> 00:37:59.549	We use this thing when we implement this is our vocal chord systems using discrete time systems.
3.srt	00:38:01.229 --> 00:38:04.249	So, next class I will just complete this DSP things.
3.srt	00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:05.529	Thank you.
