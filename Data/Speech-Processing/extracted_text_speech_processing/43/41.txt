So, this will be additive in log f 0 contour.
So, x 1 t and x 2 t is added and that change the log f 0 it is additive.
Now, if I say this relation with that language.
So, if I say phasing and accentuation.
So, there is a local variation and there is a global variation.
So, if I say the global variation is phasing and local variation is accentuation accent.
