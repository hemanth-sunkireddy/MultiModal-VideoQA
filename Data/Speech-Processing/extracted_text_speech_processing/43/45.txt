then I can say this angle is nothing but a theta.
So, this is rotation.
Now, if I translate it, then it is L plus x.
If I move this direction, then it is L plus x.
So, L is the length of the vocalic, x is the extension of elongation of vocalic, theta is the angular displacement of the thyroid.
So, if I do the angular displacement, there also will be a length change.
If I do the transformation,
