I can do some stylization means I can linearly approximate this f 0 contour.
So, I can say whole f 0 contour is nothing but a sum of some linear line within this line f 0 is fixed.
So, this is called piecewise linear approximation or I can generate a mathematical model by which changing the parameter I can generate this.
