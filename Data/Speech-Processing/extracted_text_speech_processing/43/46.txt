there also will be a change of length and that is L minus L 0 which is produced by which is represented by x t and this x t is summation of these two change in logarithmic domain one is rotation another is translation.
And this rotation and translations are nothing but a spring mass movement.
So, if it is a spring mass movement there is a second order differential equation.
If you remember that spring mass movement of a body mechanical vibration.
