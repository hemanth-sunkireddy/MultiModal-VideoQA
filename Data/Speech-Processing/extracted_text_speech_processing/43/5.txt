but English is contrastive trace language.
So, you can say the F 0 is convey the linguistic information also like the tone.
It can be phonemic also.
So, that means variation of the tone change the word meaning.
Then F 0 is convey the prosodic meaning of the sentence.
If I put the trace in different location, the meaning may be change.
