has a some parameter and I can varies those parameter to generate this F 0 contour that is called generation process, Fujisaki generation process model.
So, we will discuss details on generation process model.
So, this is called Fujisaki generation process F 0 contour modeling that if you remember we have said F 0 has a two kinds of variation one is called local variation.
