it is a superposition, but in if it is non logarithm then it is a multiplication.
So, this superposition, so they are superimposed with normal f 0 with the x n component and phase component.
So, that way we are changing the f 0, so translation and rotation details are is there.
So, you can see this is this kind of system.
So, this is there is a membrane, so it can rotate.
