local accent.
So, then I can say accent is controlled by rotation of thyroid muscle and phasing is controlled by translation.
So, translation mechanism control the global variation.
So, translation effect is time if it is x t. So, translation will change the f 0 in roughly change the f 0 and rotation will change the local variation.
So, global variation plus local variation in logarithmic f 0.
