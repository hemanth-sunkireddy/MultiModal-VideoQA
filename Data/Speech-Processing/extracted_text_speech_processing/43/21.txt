A.
Incremental tension d t by d x that is the relationship.
A and B are constant.
Then muscle elongation and tension t. So, I can say how much muscle has to be elongated to produce certain tension that is required.
So, that is the relationship.
So, the elongation is x and tension is t. A relationship is t is equal to
