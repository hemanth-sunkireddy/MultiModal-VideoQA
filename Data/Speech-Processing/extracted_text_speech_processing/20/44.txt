So, in that case the similarity becomes reduce again it will multiply with the same signal when it will come in here.
So, after complete one period again the signal once this same kind of similar kind of signal will multiply each other.
So, summation will be increases.
So, I can say r 0, r 1, r 2, r 3 if I calculate those r value with respect to different l.
