Now, if I want to normalize with respect to window length, then I again normalize with L. This is for first window.
So, same thing will happen for any window throughout the signal.
So, generalized formula for calculating the zero crossing rate is this one.
And this is the block diagram.
First signal pass through the minus 1 and 1, I make it, then take the difference.
