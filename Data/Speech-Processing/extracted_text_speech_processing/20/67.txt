I can say it is a sibilant below this threshold value I can say it is a voiced or silent.
If there is a silence can also have a high threshold value, but if you see the Z m and energy if I combine then I can say whether it is a silence or sibilant.
Sibilant amplitude will be high at least voicing sibilant there will be some power, but in silence only background noise will be there.
So, power will be reduced.
So, that way I can find out this parameter can be used for voicing and unvoicing detection.
