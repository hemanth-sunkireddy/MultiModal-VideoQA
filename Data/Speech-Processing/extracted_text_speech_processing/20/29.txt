the 1 second is divided into 100 point.
So, now sampling frequency come down to the instead of F s it is 100 sampling rate the frame rate divided that sampling frequency.
So, I get a 1 value here 1 value here that way 100 value I get.
So, 100 z value I get then if I plot those 100 z value.
So, if the signal is sibilant or if the fricative
