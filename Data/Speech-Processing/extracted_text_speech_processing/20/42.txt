1, then I get a value, then I get a value r 2, then I get a value of r 3 just shifted.
So, if I shifted it, if you think in a sine wave manner, let this is a sample, this is a sample, this is a sample, this is a sample, this is a sample, this is a sample, again sine wave 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
Now, once I multiply this with this, I get
