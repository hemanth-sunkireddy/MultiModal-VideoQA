If you see the occlusion period of paw is nothing but a silence.
So, I do not know where the paw is started.
Because when it start voicing I know here the voicing is started.
So, that is nothing but a paw to next voicing transition, but I do not know where the paw is begin whether it is begin in here or whether it is begin in here I do not know.
Similarly, if there is a some fricative weak fricative like paw.
