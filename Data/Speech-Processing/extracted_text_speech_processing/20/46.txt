at red color.
So, what is the definition of a fundamental frequency?
Signal repeat itself.
So, when it will be repeat?
If the sample value was similar.
So, I can say the signal repeated in here, signal repeated in here, signal repeated in here.
So, this is nothing but a f 0, this is nothing but a twice f 0, this is nothing but a thrice f 0.
So, that can be used to calculate the fundamental frequency of the signal.
