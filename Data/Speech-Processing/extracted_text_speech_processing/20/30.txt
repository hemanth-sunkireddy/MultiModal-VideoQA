So, if I see the example, if the sibilant signal, so number of zero crossing will be much high.
So, z corresponding window z value will be very high.
If it is signal is voice, signal is voice kind of signal, number of zero crossing will be less.
So, z value will be low.
So, depending on the z value, I can say whether this signal is sibilant or this signal is silent.
