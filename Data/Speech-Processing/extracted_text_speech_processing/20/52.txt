take this first sample.
Take the difference between this sample, this sample, this sample, this sample, this sample, this sample, this sample and sum it up.
Then take this with difference of this sample, this sample and with difference of this sample with difference difference of this sample.
So, x 0 minus x of n which n varies from 0 to n minus 1 k. So, k equal to 0 means x x x 0 minus x 0.
