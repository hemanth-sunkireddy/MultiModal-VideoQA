how many samples are there.
So, if F s is the number of sample and F 0 is the frequency.
So, F s by F 0 sample will be there per cycle which I have discussed already.
So, two time per cycle.
So, every cycle how many samples are there F s by F 0 every cycle.
So, cycles is equal to F s by F 0 sample.
