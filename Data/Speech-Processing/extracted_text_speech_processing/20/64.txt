and 0 crossing rate for every 10 millisecond I get that one.
So, if it is 1 second signal if it is 10 millisecond is the frame rate.
So, I can get a 100 frame value.
So, coincide with the signal.
So, I can say this frame corresponding to this energy, this frame corresponding to this energy, this frame corresponding to this energy, this frame corresponding to this so I can get a energy plot like this.
Now, if I have to define a threshold.
So,
