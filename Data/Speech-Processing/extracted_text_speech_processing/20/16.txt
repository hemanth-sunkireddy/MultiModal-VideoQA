how many times signal cross the 0 line.
So, if I say if I generally drawn suppose those are the sample.
So, when the 0 crossing will be happened this is a sample once the signal sample will come this side.
So, this is the positive sample this is the negative sample.
So, there will be a 0 crossing.
Similarly, there is a negative sample negative sample then once it is a positive sample then there will be a 0 crossing.
