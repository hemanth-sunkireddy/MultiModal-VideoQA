So, I get a signal I normalize the amplitude of that whole signal and take find out the threshold value from some previous study and adjust the threshold value to find the voice and unvoice detection.
Similarly, for every 10 millisecond I get a Z m value.
So, if it is noisy so Z m value will be very high.
So, I can get the Z m plot will be look like this again down down down.
So, again I can say the Z m value if it is high above this threshold value.
