So, this is nothing but will look like a x 0 although it is not x l. So, it is x k when x k minus x 0 is equal to 0 then the difference will be minimum almost 0.
So, I can say the definition of a phase is that if the two samples are identical after n delay then n is called period.
So, the if you know that x of n is equal to x of n plus n.
