I have already explained in last class also.
So, if you see, if I take a signal, this is my signal, then if I select this portion, if I analyze it, then I, if I can, this is the spectrum.
So, spectrogram plot of spectrum of the signal, selected signal.
So, this axis is the frequency axis, this axis is the amplitude axis of the mod of x k. So, instead of discrete frequency, I can write f also.
