a formant frequency using spacing some filter along the spectrum.
So, that can be possible.
So, suppose I have a, so what is the baseband if the sampling frequency is f s, how much n I should take?
I should take up to n by 2 because it is symmetry, DFT is a symmetry.
So, I can say if it is a f s, then maximum baseband frequency is f s by 2.
So, if I have a DFT length is n.
