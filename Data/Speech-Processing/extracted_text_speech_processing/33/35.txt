So, this axis is the k axis discrete frequency k and this axis the amplitude of the amplitude mod of x k. So, this is mod of x k axis.
So, k equal to 0 I get here.
So, I get this kind of speech spectrum.
Note that smooth I am drawing it smooth.
If you draw it real then if you see you get this kind of speech spectrum.
