and plot with frequency.
So, mod of S k is nothing but a frequency versus power plot which is the spectrum in normal frequency scale.
Now, I work the frequency scale in male scale, male frequency or you can say the male filter bank.
I pass that with the male filter bank.
When I pass with the male filter bank, what I will get?
I get same spectrum.
