So, if I calculate the spectral coefficient from LPC spectrum using this three formula, I get the spectral coefficient from LPC spectrum.
So, LPC spectral coefficient.
If I know the spectral coefficient, I can calculate the LPC coefficient using this formula.
So, all are the speech parameter.
The spectral is a speech parameter.
LPC coefficient is a speech parameter.
