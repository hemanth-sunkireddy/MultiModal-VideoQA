then this is called male scale spectral coefficient.
So, since the my spectrum is frequency warp in male scale, that is why it is called male frequency spectral coefficient.
So, what I am actually doing in mathematics?
I am designing the filters.
I will explain in the next class.
First, I design the describe the
