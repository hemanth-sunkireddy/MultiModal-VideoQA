plus complex sep term of minus n then divided by 2.
This we said if the x n is the complex sep term and c n is the real sep term.
Now, we will go for the proof of it.
Can we prove it?
Yes, you can prove it.
So, now, I am going to prove it.
So, what we will do?
First think about that real sep term.
What is c n?
Real sep term means inverse Fourier 2 pi minus pi 2 pi.
