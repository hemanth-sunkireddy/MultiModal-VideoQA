which is the most used parameter in speech application.
MFCC are used in most of the cases, most of the cases MFCC is used.
So, compute, so you can say that there is three simple step in MFCC computation.
Compute FFTT power spectrum of the speech signal, apply MEL filter bank and then compute DCT.
Why?
I will come, why these steps we require.
So, what we said.
