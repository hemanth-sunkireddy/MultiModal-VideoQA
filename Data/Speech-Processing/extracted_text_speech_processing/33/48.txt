So, if I take the male scale filter, then let us I take the male scale filter.
If you find out that if it is 4 kilohertz, I think 20 filter will be sufficient to cover the 4 kilohertz frequency or entire frequency range.
And so, I can get m 1, m 2 up to m 2 because every filter give me a single point bandwidth, single bandwidth.
