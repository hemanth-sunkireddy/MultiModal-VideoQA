that if I take the spectrum of a speech signal, so how do you draw the spectrum of a speech signal?
You know if X n is my time domain signal, if I apply DFT, I will get X k. I am not explaining the framing and windowing.
So, that also included the speech processing framing and windowing.
Instead of taking the whole signal at a time, I have a whole signal.
