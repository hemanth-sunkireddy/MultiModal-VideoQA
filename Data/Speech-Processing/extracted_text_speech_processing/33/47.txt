we have a some low resolution.
That means, the band of frequency, the frequency band we perceive as a same frequency is larger.
So, I can say at the high frequency region, the bandwidth of the filter will be large.
So, that means, we do not require that much of coarse resolution.
So, rough estimation is sufficient for high frequency.
So, that is why we take the bandwidth of the filter will be larger.
So, bandwidth defined by the .
