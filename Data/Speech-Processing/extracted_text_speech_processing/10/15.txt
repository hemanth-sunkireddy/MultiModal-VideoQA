What is that?
T minus x by c, so I can say this is called forward wave, this is called backward wave.
So, in the tube there is a forward wave and there is a backward wave.
In the forward wave I can say the if the time axis this is the time axis is the forward wave then T is minus x by c. If it is the backward wave, so negative direction T plus x by c.
