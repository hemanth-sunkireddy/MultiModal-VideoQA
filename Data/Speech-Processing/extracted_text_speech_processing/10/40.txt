another is cos.
So, if I say how the pressure amplitude pressure wave amplitude and volume velocity amplitude is vary inside the tube then I can say only x axis here x only I am I drawing the envelope portion.
So, one is sin another is cos.
So, if this is cos is the volume velocity.
So, if the particle velocity is maximum then pressure wave is minimum 0.
So, particle velocity will vary like this.
