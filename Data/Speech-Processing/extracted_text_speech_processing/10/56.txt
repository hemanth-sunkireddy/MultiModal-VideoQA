the system response will be 0 that is why it is called pole 0.
So, every pole corresponding to a resonance in speech those resonance are called formant ok.
In speech those resonance are called formant.
So, I know if I want to know the formant response or frequency response of V omega V a omega then I have to find out where its resonance is occur.
When the resonance ESS is present it will know that , ok shall be loger or not .
C exit to C exit to N. C exit to C exit to N, ir says that .
C exit to T exit to 190.
Its yet again equal.
