second formant and third formant is 1 kilohertz it is fixed because tube length is fixed.
This is similar with your earlier physics theory that if this side is closed then the first harmonics will occur at lambda by 4.
So, L is equal to lambda by 4.
So, F is equal to C by lambda which becomes C by 4 L. C is the velocity and L is the length of the tube which is thin.
