pole every pole.
So, if I have a 5 pole I get 5 resonance frequency.
So, if the fifth order Q is the order is the fifth that means, I can get the fifth solution 5 solution 5 solution give me the 5 resonance frequency.
How many solution I can get here cos theta is equal to 0 when when omega L by C is equal to 2 n plus 1 into pi by 2 cos pi by 2.
