omega will give me the pole that is why p h omega is called the pole 0 function.
So, 0 and pole now what is the physical significance of pole suppose I said there is a pole what do you mean by pole physically what will happen.
Now, if you see what do you mean by solution of q omega at solution point q omega will be 0 if I put it 0 then h omega value will be infinite at solution point of p omega.
