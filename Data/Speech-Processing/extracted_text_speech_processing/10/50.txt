So, there is some pole and some solution of P will give me the 0 solution of Q will give me the pole.
So, if you see solution of Q when Q omega Q omega is equal to 0 then what is the amplitude value?
Value is infinite that means, at the pole the resonance of the system is occur.
So, I get the highest energy maximum energy resonance will be occur at
