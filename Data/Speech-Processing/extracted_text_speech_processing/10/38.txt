if the x is variation of x is very small then I can say that z is equal to nothing but a z z is nothing but a j omega rho by c rho by a into del x omega.
So, simplification of that for a small x del x is very small then I can do that ok. Now, so this is a z now if I interpreted this thing the part this is particle velocity the volume velocity this is pressure wave.
