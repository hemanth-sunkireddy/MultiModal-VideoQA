Now, if I say volume velocity, so if you see volume velocity, if the velocity is v of let us tube with the cross sectional area is a, then what is the volume velocity a into v the total volume v is the length of the tube and a is the cross sectional area.
So, v is the a into v is the volume.
So, if I say volume velocity is u, then u is equal to v by a or sorry u is equal to v into a.
