in the air.
Now, if I see that that this one this tube whole tube is nothing, but a this kind of situation pressure or you can say the pressure is applied in here acoustical pressure is applied in here.
So, I can say the particle velocity in this point I can say or volume velocity in this point is u 0 t and volume velocity at this point is u.
