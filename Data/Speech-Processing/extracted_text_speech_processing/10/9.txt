is analogous to C. So, it is called acoustical capacitance.
a by rho c square is acoustical capacitance and rho by a is the acoustical inductance.
p is analogous to voltage, current is analogous to volume velocity ok.
So, if you see this slide I have written this slide same things I have written in this slide ok. Now, so this I know.
So, I can say that if I know the equation I can analogous electric transmission line I can also draw.
