If omega L by C is equal to 3 pi by 2, then F will becomes 1.5 kilohertz.
So, it is F 1 first formant, second formant.
If it is third formant, then omega L by C is equal to 5 pi by 2, then it will become 2.5 kilohertz.
If you see distance between the first formant and second formant is 1 kilohertz.
