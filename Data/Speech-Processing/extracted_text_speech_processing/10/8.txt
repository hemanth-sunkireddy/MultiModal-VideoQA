domain is analogous to voltage in electrical domain.
Similarly, u is analogous to i, volume velocity in acoustic domain is equivalent to electrical current in electrical domain.
And if I say l is equal to rho by a, so this rho by a is called acoustical inductance, acoustical inductance.
Similarly, I can say that a by rho c square
