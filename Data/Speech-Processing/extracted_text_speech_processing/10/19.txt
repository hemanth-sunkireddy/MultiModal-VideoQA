I excited the tube with unit impulse or I guess every frequency and I want to find out the every frequency response at the output ok. That is why I said omega E j omega t and this excitation is if it is impulse then that or you can say the excitation content all the frequency is equal amplitude and that amplitude is modify as per the gotel response gotel frequency response that is this u g omega ok.
So, I can say
