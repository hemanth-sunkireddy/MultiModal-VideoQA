So, I can say k plus minus k minus is equal to u g omega and here I can say z d is equal to k e to this is equal to this.
So, I can this is the equation number 1 and this is equation number 2 again I can solve for k plus and k minus.
I am not deducing the solution because you can do it easily.
So, you can just deduce the solution and find out the k plus and k minus.
