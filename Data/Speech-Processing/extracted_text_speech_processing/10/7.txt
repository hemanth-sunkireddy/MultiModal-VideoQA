is equal to C into del V by del t ok. Now, this is analogous to so, this two equation analogous to this is the electrical transmission line equation lossless electrical transmission line equation.
Then I can say if this this equation is analogous to this equation then I can say that P is analogous to V. So, pressure in acoustic domain
