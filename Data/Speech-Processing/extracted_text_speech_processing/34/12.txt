male scale spectrum.
Then I can take the log of S cap L because spectral coefficient has to be calculated using homomorphic decomposition which require the log.
So, log of S L and then I take the DCT instead of IDFT.
Instead of IDFT, I take the DCT.
So, complete block diagram MFCC filter MFCC equation.
So, this block diagram
