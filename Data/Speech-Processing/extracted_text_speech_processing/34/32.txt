then calculate the spectrum and modify the spectrum as per the critical band or male frequency spectral spectrum or bark scale.
Then modify the equal modify the loudness loudness of the amplitude of the spectrum as per the equal loudness curve.
Then apply the power law of hearing what is power law?
If you remember
