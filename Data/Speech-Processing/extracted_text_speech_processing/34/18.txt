So, if you see the second formant are moving, even first formant is also moving.
So, I can see there is a formant movement or I can say there is a dynamics of the parameter changing across the segment.
So, that dynamics also can be a good feature.
So, if I want to capture those dynamics, so this is represent the frame 1, this is represent the frame 2, this is represent the frame 3.
So, what is the dynamics?
Dynamics, this
