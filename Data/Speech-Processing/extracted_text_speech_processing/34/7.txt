So, if it is 100 hertz how many k will be there?
So, k equal to 264 k equal to 3 96 hertz.
So, k equal to 3 I can say almost k equal to 3.
So, what is the power?
So, k equal to 0 multiply by the filter multiply by the filter white function.
So, m l m l k is the filter white function.
So, if it is this is my this is the my first filter I am designing.
