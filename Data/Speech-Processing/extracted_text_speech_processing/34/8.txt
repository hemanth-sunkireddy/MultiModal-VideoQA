So, that required k equal to 0 to k equal to 3.
So, the value of S k multiply by m k. So, m k means k equal to 0, S k is k equal to 0, mod of S k I can calculate the mod of S k. So, mod of S k I can get it.
So, this capital S k here in this equation in the slide is represent the mod of S k original spectrum.
So, if it is original spectrum, this is nothing but a capital S k I can write down.
So, original spectrum
