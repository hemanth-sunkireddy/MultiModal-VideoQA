to uncorrelate this filter output.
That is why I use DCT and DCT acts like an FFT.
Here I have used DCT because this is a complex.
So, the complex arithmetic is required, but DCT implementation is easy in this stage.
That is why instead of FFT, we use DCT, discrete cosine transform.
Now, I go for the delta spectrum.
