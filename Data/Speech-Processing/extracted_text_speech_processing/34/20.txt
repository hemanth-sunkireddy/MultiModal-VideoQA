order dynamics.
If I want to calculate the second order dynamics, so difference between the first order dynamics is nothing but the second order dynamics.
So, first order dynamics is called delta coefficient.
So, double delta is nothing but a difference of difference.
So, I can say double delta coefficient F 3 minus F 2 minus F 2 plus F 1.
So, it is nothing but a F 3 minus twice F 2.
