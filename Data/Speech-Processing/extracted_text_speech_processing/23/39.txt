4 pole ok.
So, order of that LPC analysis it is not arbitrary, it depends on the sampling frequency, it depends on the sampling frequency.
So, based on the sampling frequency I can take the order and find out the LPC analysis ok. Now, there is another another another question is there how LPC analysis then if I have a speech signal I extract that filter LPC analysis give me the alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3 value.
