I can find out the covariance method to detect the this to find out that LPC coefficient.
So, what we want?
We want the same things, same solution of that matrix, solution of this matrix ok.
This we have already derived.
Now, the difference is that in this matrix that I have not taken the outside the window signal is 0.
