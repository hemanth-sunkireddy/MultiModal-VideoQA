A transpose alpha is equal to D inverse y.
So, I put that A value, I put the alpha value matrix D transpose and y, then I can get that alpha 4, alpha 3, alpha 2, alpha 1.
So, it is reverse order we are getting.
You can write down the equation generalize program.
So, I can using this matrix decomposition technique, I also can calculate the alpha value.
