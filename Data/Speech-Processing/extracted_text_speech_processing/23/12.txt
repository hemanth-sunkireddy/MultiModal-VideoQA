by E I minus 1 this is the equation number 1 this is the equation number 2 then I can put that value and this K I is called partial correlation coefficient per cab partial correlation coefficient ok. Then we can solve for alpha J I and this alpha I I K I this is the fourth equation ok.
So, final solution for a order P.
