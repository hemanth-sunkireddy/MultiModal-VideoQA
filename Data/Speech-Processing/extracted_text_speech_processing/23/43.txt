And if you see the red color, where LPC analysis is 10.
So, there is a lot of formants are there.
So, I can see that it is roughly estimate that spectral envelope.
If I increase the LPC order, the number of variation is increases.
So, it accurately increase the it accurately the spectrum envelope.
So, depending on my requirement, if I want the smooth spectrum,
