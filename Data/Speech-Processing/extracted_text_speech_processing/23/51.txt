into x is the radian is the frequency.
If it is hertz then I can convert f s is in hertz.
So, I can say f s by 2 pi into x hertz is my Fermin frequency.
So, suppose I have a pole I do not know whether the example is here or not no example is not there.
So, suppose the theta is equal to let us 30 degree or let us pi by 3.
So, what is the Fermin frequency?
