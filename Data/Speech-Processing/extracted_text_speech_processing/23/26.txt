So, normalize.
So, if you see the autocorrelation the value of reflection coefficient or K i or alpha i both are depends on r value autocorrelation value of autocorrelation.
So, sometime if you find that value of if it is magnitude is change of the speech signal then may be r value will be change and autocorrelation.
