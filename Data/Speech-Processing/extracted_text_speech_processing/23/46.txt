you can go through that slides I am not details describe this frequency analysis equation and this is the LPC spectrogram because here if you see the formants are more more much more clear ok.
This is done how it is how it is plotted you suppose you have a speech signal you take a window find out the LPC coefficient take the spectrogram of the LPC spectrum of the draw the magnitude spectrum of the LPC coefficient then for that time
