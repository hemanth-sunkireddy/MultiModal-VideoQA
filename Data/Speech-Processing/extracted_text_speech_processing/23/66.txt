will be phi there is a some typing mistake.
So, phi 2 2 minus a 2 1 square into d 1 this will be phi all are phi this is phi.
So, I can write down the program I can generalize this d equation and generalize the a equation and write down that program.
So, I can find out the d and a value ok. Now, once I get the d and a value let us I find out.
