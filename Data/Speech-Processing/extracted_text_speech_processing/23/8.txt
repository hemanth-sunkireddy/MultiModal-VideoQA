nothing else in the mathematics.
So, I can say gamma minus i to the power 1 is equal to this and then I can I can say this is the triphazoid matrix special symmetry we can reverse the order of the equation we can reverse it and then once we revert we can combine in two set of multiplication factor R n this this is minus and this is minus both side.
So, it is remain same ok and then we choose i minus 1.
So, that the vector this k i right side has only a single non-zero entity.
