plot this in this frequency scale again shift it and plot it and that way you get the LPC spectrogram ok.
So, the LPC spectrogram.
Now, ok formant suppose that this I will discuss later on also I have discussed in that during the tube analysis that formant position r e to the power j theta.
So, if the frequency of the formant frequency of the formant is given by f s by 2 pi.
