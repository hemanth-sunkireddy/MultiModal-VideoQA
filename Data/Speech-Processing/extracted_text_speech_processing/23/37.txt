will be half.
So, complex pole.
So, if it is 8 kilohertz then 8 k divided by 1000.
So, I can say 8.
If it is 16 kilohertz then 16 k divided by 1000, 16.
If it is 32 kilohertz 32 k divided by 1000.
So, it is 32.
So, those are for formant that means those are for tube only.
Next is there is a glottis and there is a radiation loss.
For glottis, there is
