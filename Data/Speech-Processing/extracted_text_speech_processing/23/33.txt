So, those are the autocorrelation solution ok. Now, how do you define the order of the p?
So, I say prediction order.
So, how you which factor the p is dependent?
Prediction order I have to take a signal which is 8 kilohertz sampling rate, I have take a signal which is 16 kilohertz sample, I have take a signal which is 32 kilohertz sample.
So, make different sampling rate I can sample the speech signal.
Now, what kind of order I should use?
