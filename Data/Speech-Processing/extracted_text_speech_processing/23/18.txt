J is also 1 equal to J p, J varies from 1 to p. So, what I want?
I want a set of alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha p, but those set of alpha value can be extracted in iterative matter alpha 1 1, alpha 1 2, alpha 1 3 to alpha 1 p. So, alpha 1 p is the my final answer.
So, using this four equation, I am going
