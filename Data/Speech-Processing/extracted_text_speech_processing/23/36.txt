2 complex conjugate pole is required to realize one formant.
So, it is 2.
So, F s by 2 into 2 pole how many every 1000 hertz signal.
So, I can say F s by 2 into 2 by 1000 2 2 cancel.
So, I can say F s by 1000 number of pole number of complex conjugate pole complex pole not conjugate conjugate then it is.
