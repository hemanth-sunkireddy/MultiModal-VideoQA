So, this is a normalized autocorrelation.
So, this is the that program you can implement it and find out whether it is happen or not.
Then that is the tax I have given the consider a sample p is equal to second order p is equal to find the solution.
So, I can give you let us x n is equal to I give you not speech signal let us 1 2 5 minus 1 2 like that and then I told you that for p is equal to 2.
