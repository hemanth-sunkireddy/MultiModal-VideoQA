things because Z is Z is nothing, but a R into e to the power j theta or you can use that R theta equation in tube model ok.
So, both way if I know the formant bandwidth and formant frequency I can derive the transfer function linear LTI transfer function or if I know the that if I know that pole position or pole value or theta and R.
