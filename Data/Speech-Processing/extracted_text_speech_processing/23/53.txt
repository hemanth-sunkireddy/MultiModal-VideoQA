this is Z k R log of R R you know that log of R R what is R?
R is nothing but a absolute value.
So, if it is complex pole is A plus J B then I can say root over of A square plus B square or mod of if it is pole is Z k mod of mod of Z k give me the R. So, I can say pi by F s F s by pi into minus log of abs.
