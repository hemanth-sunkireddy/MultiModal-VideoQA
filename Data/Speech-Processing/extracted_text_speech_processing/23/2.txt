R n 2 like that and R is nothing but a that matrix this matrix.
So, R is this matrix and small r n is this matrix ok.
So, this matrix and this matrix ok. Now, we have to solve this how to solve this solving is done based on the Levinson and Darwin's methods.
So, what is this methods basically I am not details describe the methods, but let us go through that.
So, basically this equation can be solved.
