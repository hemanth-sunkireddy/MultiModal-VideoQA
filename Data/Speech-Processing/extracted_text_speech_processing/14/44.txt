Then, if I put the value of R 1 and R 2, the equation will become 2 by 1 plus R g 1 minus R g z to the power n by 2.
So, if you see the R k is z to the power half.
So, I can say if it is n, so it is z to the power n by 2 k equal to 1 to n 1 by 1 plus R k. R 1 z to the power minus half for R 2 z to the power minus z to the power half.
