minus r 2 z to the power minus 2.
If I evaluate, so this matrix will be 1 0, I can say first evaluate these two, then come to the here this side.
So, if I write down the equation, then whole equation 1 by v z is nothing but a, I can multiply this thing 1 plus r 1 1 plus r 2 and this thing I can multiply together and I can find out.
So, v z is nothing but
