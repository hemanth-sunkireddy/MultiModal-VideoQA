into 1 0 I can say that.
So, which is nothing but a 1 by v z 1 by the transfer function.
So, v z I want to find out v z which v z is equal to u l z divided by u g z.
So, it is nothing but a 1 by v z.
So, 1 by v z I can write in term of 2 by 1 plus R g 1 minus R g R 1 R 2 R 3 R n 1 0 ok. Now, if I write that.
