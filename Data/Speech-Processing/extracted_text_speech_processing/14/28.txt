So, u 1, u 1 plus, u 1 minus, u 1 minus z, u 1 plus, u 1 minus z, you can see that blue and yellow.
So, those are the equation.
Now, if I say let us u k is nothing but a consist of 2 plus u k plus z and u k minus z.
Whole u k is nothing but a forward wave and backward wave and from here I can write u k is nothing but a
