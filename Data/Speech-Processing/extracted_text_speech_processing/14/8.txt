So, n section create a delay n tau, but that is the first first signal first delta that is why b 0 into delta n, but after all the signal the after the first round that that delay will be there.
So, what is the delay 2 tau is the round tip delay.
So, this is the first arrival of the signal second will be arrival due to the back propagation.
So, there will be a 2 tau delay.
