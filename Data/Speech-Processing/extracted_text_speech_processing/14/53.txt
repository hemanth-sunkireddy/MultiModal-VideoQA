we can say 2 pole or it is a second order equation.
So, I have a single 0 for 2 tube model, I have a 0 at center 1 0 and 2 pole.
So, at origin 1 0 and 2 pole.
So, if I have a n tube model, I can say n by 2 0 at origin and nth this equation become n order.
So, I can say there will be n number of pole.
