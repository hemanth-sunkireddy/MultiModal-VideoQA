So, if I able to simplify all pole digital filter and if I know alpha k, if I know alpha k which is nothing but in term of R 1 R 2 and the R 1 R 2 R g I have to know.
So, what is R 1 R 2?
All are reflection coefficient.
If I know all reflection coefficient, I can simulate this dz.
So, it is impossible to implement this dz using digital filter.
