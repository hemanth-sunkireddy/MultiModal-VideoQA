So, I can draw the equation like this way.
Let this is UGN, then the first junction, second junction, dot dot dot, nth n minus 1 junction and this is the and if you see the last one is the boundary condition at left and this one is the boundary condition at rightist.
So, it is RG, it is half of 1 plus RG, it is minus RL, 1 plus RL.
I can draw the n tube equivalent signal diagram, signal flow diagram and each delay is represented by z to the power.
