k equal to 1 to n alpha k z to the power minus k. So, kth pole will nth pole will be the n number of pole will be there.
So, I can write down the equation 1 plus k equal to 1 to n alpha k z to the power minus k and n by 2 0 at origin.
So, instead of writing this the all 0 model z to the power minus 1 minus half in here z to the power minus half in here.
