for 2 tube.
If I consider that my length of tube whole vocal cord is vocal track is simulated using 2 tube.
So, if it is 2 tube, so n is equal to 2.
If I put n equal to 2, then 1 by v z will become 2 by 1 plus R g will be same.
This will be 1 minus R g will be there.
So, there is no effect on here.
