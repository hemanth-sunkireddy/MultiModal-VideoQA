is the sampling frequency?
10 kilohertz.
10 kilohertz is the sampling frequency.
So, band limited is 5 kilohertz, Nyquist criteria is 10 kilohertz.
So, if I want to reach the Nyquist criteria in this 2 tau delay, so 2 tau must be equal to the sample period.
So, 2 tau is equal to sample period.
If 2 tau is equal to sample period.
