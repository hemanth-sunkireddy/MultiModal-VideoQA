minus t, x equal to 0, here x equal to 0.
So, from here what I have to find out?
Again I want to find out the what the volume expression of the volume velocity which is input to the track forward wave and the backward wave, then I can draw the circuits.
So, from there I want to find out u t plus t. From this equation I want to find out
