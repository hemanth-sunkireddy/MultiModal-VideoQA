is the current which will passing through this to the tube.
So, I can say volume velocity at the tube input is nothing but a total u g t the total volume velocity produced by the glottis minus the volume velocity which is passing through the load you can say the glottal load u z g. So, this total current minus the load current.
So, load current if the z g is the load and voltage is p g t then p g t is the z g is the.
