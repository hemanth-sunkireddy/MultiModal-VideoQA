then from the equation I can draw the signal flow diagram for a single tube model considering two boundary conditions.
Now, instead of a single tube if I consider that freeze production system is nothing but a multiple tube then what should be the transfer function and how do we implement it.
So, next class we will start there.
Thank you.
