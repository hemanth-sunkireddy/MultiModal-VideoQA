If it is sampled at 8 kilohertz, then single sample delay means 1 by 8 kilohertz.
This is a single sample delay.
So, 1 by 8 kilohertz, I think 125 microsecond.
Then how much delay will be required?
0.5 millisecond.
I can calculate the number of Z is required.
So, I can instead of delay, I put Z to the power that number of n. Delay will be simulated.
