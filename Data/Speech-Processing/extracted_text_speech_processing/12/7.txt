which is the input to the vocal tract system.
Now, if I say this vocal tract vocal cords is a time bearing vocal cords because vocal cord is closing and opening closing and opening.
So, once it is completely closed so completely closed means u g is equal to 0.
If it is completely closed no volume velocity because air is completely stopped flow is completely stopped.
So, no volume velocity u g is 0.
