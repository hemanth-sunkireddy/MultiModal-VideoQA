will cause an particle velocity or volume velocity u in the vocal track.
So, that how do you make the word.
So, if I say the impedance of the vocal cords is nothing, but a resistance and inductive impedance that lets it is a l g and it is r g like the load ok.
So, now this pressure pass through that impedance and create a vocal cord or you can say volume velocity u g.
