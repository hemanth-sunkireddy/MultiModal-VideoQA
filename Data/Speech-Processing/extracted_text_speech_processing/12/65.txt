and I get the digital circuit if I know the R L and R G. So, next this kind of mathematics you can practice later on.
Let us then we discuss about the multi tube modeling.
So, next class we will discuss about the multi tube modeling.
So, single tube modeling we derive the signal flow diagram.
You do not have to remember it.
If you understand that things if you able to derive this equation.
