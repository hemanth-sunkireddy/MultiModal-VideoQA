So, when this UG will be 0, if the impedance in here is infinite.
So, if I say let vocal chord opening AG is a function of T. So, opening of the vocal chord is a function of T, then impedance impedance is nothing but a 1 by AGT.
So, when the vocal chord are completely closed then AG opening AGT is equal to.
