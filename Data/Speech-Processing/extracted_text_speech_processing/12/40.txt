this constraint scenario ok.
So, this is the at the leap condition.
Now, if I say the glottis side, if I discuss about the boundary condition at the glottis side.
So, I can say I know the leap side I know leap side is nothing, but a Z L which is Z L ok. Now, this side I have I have said the pressure source is replaced by a current source which is nothing, but a volume velocity which is U G 0 t.
