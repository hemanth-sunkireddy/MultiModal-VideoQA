velocity at the input of the vocal track is nothing, but a u g t minus.
So, this is the total pressure is P g t. So, total pressure is P g t divided by z g. So, this current if this this total pressure is P g t, then the pressure divided by the load is the current.
So, this current will be minus from the total current.
