First, we will discuss about the autocorrelation method.
So, there is three kinds of method autocorrelation methods, matrix method, the covariance method and another one is called the lattice filter method.
So, using these three methods, I will try to estimate the value of alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3.
So, next class we will do that.
Thank you.
