this error is minimum.
How to minimize the error?
Let us take that you know that function minimization problem.
So, minimize by setting what?
I want to set d of e n by d alpha i is equal to 0.
So, how do you minimize?
I have to minimize the function.
So, the first order differentiation with respect to for which value I for with respect to which value I minimize it?
