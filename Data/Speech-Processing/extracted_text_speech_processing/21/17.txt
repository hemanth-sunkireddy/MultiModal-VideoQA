and they will multiply with the previous sample which can be implement easily by a delay.
So, I can say this is nothing but a filter those are the coefficient of the filter and those those filter if I design a all pole filter using this coefficient and if I pass the previous p number of sample then the present p signal can be predicted.
So, this is called linear
