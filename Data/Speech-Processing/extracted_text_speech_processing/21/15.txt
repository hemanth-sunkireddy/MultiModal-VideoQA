current sample S n. So, what is this?
This is nothing but a linear prediction.
So, what is why it is called linear prediction?
Suppose there is a line.
If this is the line, if I know this point, this point and this point, I can say I can predict this point by linear combination of the previous point with a some coefficient factors.
So, this is called linear prediction.
