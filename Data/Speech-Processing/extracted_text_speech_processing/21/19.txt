So, what is the prediction?
So, I can say let us my prediction error is my predicted signal is x cap n which is nothing but a k equal to 1 2 p alpha k s of n minus k those are the predicted signal.
So, I can say that those are the predicted signal previous p number of sample from the previous p number of sample I let us I know the alpha k.
