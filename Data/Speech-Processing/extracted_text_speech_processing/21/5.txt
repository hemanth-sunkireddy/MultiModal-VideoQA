z to the power minus 1 square ok. And v z you have already said that if it is there is a n n junction.
So, there is a n by 2 k equal to 1 to n by 2 and this we have already derived a radiation is nothing, but a r 0 into 1 minus z to the power minus 1 pole is derived that radiation pattern.
Now, if I multiply this thing to get the H z if you see that H z can be if I say that e to the power minus c t is equal to 1 c is the velocity of time t is the time period of the Guadalupal impulse then I can get.
