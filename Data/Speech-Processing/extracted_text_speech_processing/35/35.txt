difficult to estimate speech with low energy.
High F0 can be affected by a low formant.
Yes, this is a very important issue.
If you see, if you remember the fast formant frequency is in and around 500 Hz.
So, it can reduce and it can be goes to 360 Hz also.
So, if it is 360 Hz is the fast formant frequency and if F0 is in around 300 Hz.
So, F0 can coincide with the fast formant frequency.
