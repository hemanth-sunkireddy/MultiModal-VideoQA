and the length signal is one single f 0.
Similarly, if you see if I have a base frequency is 50 hertz my f 0 can varies to up to 100 hertz within a single sentence can varies because octave second one is 2 is to 1.
Next piece is called quasi periodic if you see the speech signal it is not exactly periodic.
So, speech signal is not
