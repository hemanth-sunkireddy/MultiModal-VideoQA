So, I can say somebody is singing let us there is a guru sing the song.
So, he touches the node 1, 2, 3, 4.
So, all node movements are showing.
Now as a disciple I am singing that same song and computer showed to shown me that you started from here, but your transition from this node to this node taking this much of time and you are not touching this node.
So, next time I producing next next way then I I were gradually touching the next node.
So, that can be used as a tools for learning.
