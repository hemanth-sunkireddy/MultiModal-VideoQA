Next challenge issue is that due to the band limitation.
If you remember in telephone speech, we say telephone speech is 300 hertz to 3.5 kilohertz or 4 kilohertz.
If it is that, so below 300 hertz no signal, no component.
So, suppose I am speaking over the telephone, my fundamental frequency is 180 hertz.
