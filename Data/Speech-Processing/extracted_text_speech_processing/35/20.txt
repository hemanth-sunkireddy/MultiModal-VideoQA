I am not saying the English is converted in my mother tongue.
I am saying I am converting the same English speech which is spoken by an American speaker to my and I am listening in my own English whatever English I am producing because my English is not American English.
Think about a Japanese professor giving a lectures.
If I am listening because my I cannot understand the Japanese English that clearly.
So my understanding level will be going down.
