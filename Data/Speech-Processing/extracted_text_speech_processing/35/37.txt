f 0 is not present fundamental frequency is not there, but still receive the fundamental frequency.
Because the property of fundamental frequency says that the spectral information will repeat if you plot it you know the this is f 0 next will be twice f 0 and all the spectral component will be repeated here next will be twice f 0.
