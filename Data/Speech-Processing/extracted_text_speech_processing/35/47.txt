the 0 will be padded with the length of the signal.
So, what we will get?
I will get a autocorrelation coefficient r 1 which is less than r 0, r 2 less than r 0.
If you see the signal will be come in the in phase when it is reaches here.
So, if this much of amount of shift is there then the 0th sample will be multiplied with 0th sample.
Again I get
