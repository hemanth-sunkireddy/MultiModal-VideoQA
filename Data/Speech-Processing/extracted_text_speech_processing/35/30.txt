The f 0 is continuously moving or there may be a difference forward, backward that kind of variation.
So, it is not a smooth f 0, it can be look like this kind of f 0 contour.
So, next frequency next next period it is less, next period it is also, detail is randomly varying that is why it is called quasi periodic signal not exactly periodic signal.
Then f 0 is influenced by many factors, I cannot say the my f 0 will be same for all time.
