This time I say one sentence, next time if I say same sentence F0 may not be the same.
F0 may be different because it depends on my emotion, who is doing on emotion analysis or find out the speaker characteristics F0 has a part.
Most information is communicated by F0 only, even if you see if I say spoken language.
