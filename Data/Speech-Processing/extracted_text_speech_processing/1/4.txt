But, I am believing that not only the TTSSR, there is a other kinds of speech application also like that second language acquisition, action conversion all kinds of things.
So, those we will discuss, I will discuss at the end of the course that whatever the speech processing we have done entire course, what is the main application of those kind of information in this course.
So, what I expect from the every learner that not that cover.
