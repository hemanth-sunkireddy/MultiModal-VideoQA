I can say something on the here also so you see that categorize and label the different speech sound for a given speech signal based on the spectrographic view or time domain signal view so what I expect from the learner that what once I completed the course the learner should able to do or learner should able to categorize suppose I give you a speech signal and I told you to records a speech signal as your name.
