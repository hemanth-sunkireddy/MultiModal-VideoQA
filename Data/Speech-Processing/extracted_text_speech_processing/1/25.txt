So, at the end of the course, you should able to write the algorithm for find out the different kind of speech parameter that is my expectation.
Then extraction of the spectral time domain parameters speech signal those things in then design of simple TTS and ASR system I will cover and I will cover some part of the prosody modeling.
Because today prosody modeling one of the important aspects in speech processing class.
If you see there is lot of work is going on speech processing class.
