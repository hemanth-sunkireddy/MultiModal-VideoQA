I will cover some of the disciplines, not all the disciplines.
So, some of the disciplines I will cover mainly focused on acoustics part of the speech and phonetics, acoustics and phonetics and signal processing part of the speech.
So, thank you.
So, next lectures I will discuss how to record the speech, because before you go to anything on speech processing, you should know how do I record my speech and how do I see it in my laptops or computer.
