There is a lot of segmental speech work is done.
If you see the TTS, most of the TTS are in Indian language.
I have developed one TTS in Indian language using different method.
I will explain that also, but it is not as like natural as human being.
So what we are missing is that speech prosodi.
So today if you heard any speech scientist, any speech lab, if you go there, lot of people are working on speech prosodi.
