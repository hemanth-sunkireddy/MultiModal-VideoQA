speech perception and speech production.
That is not that much of skill oriented things, but yes you should know what is the how the speech is produced and how the speech is perceived.
So there is a lot of problem I will solve using the speech perception and speech production.
Next one is suppose you know that this is a speech production mechanism that here the speech is produced using the vocal cords and there is a tube.
You should have experience with that.
