frequency response of the unit impulse will be modified by the filter frequency response.
Details of how what should be the formant structures will come on when we model this speech production system.
So, all the voice sounds are characterized by the formant frequency for different voice sound has different kind of formant frequency that is why they sound like different sound.
So, then if just this we have already explained that why that woman has shorter f 0 and formant frequency.
