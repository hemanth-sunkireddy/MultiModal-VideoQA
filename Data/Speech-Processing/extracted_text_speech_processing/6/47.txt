then I call voiced sound.
So any bilabial plosive has two varieties, two manner of articulation depending on the source vocal cords.
Either it can be voiced or it can be unvoiced.
So if you see the chart, it is written P for unvoiced, B for next one is for voiced.
So there are two places, unvoiced and voiced.
