place of articulation has produced different sound.
How do I describe the place?
So, different place are if you see the bilabial, labiodental, dental, alveolar, postalveolar, retroflex, palatal, velar, uvalar, pharyngeal and glottal.
So, if I see the upper track of the human speech production system which is there in here, if you see the different upper cavity can be part in different place.
