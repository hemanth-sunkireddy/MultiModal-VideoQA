For example, suppose I want to produce the vowel ah.
So, I can see the vocal cords is vibrating and hip of the tongue is raised ah.
So, the place where the obstruction is happened is called place of articulation.
And manner, manner means how I produce that sound.
That means when I produce the sound, I produce the sound.
