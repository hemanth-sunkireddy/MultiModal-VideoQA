phonetic alphabet.
I can assign a symbol to each an individual sound, depending on the place and manner of articulation.
Now, sound has a consonant.
I already discussed.
We have a consonant, we have a vowel, we have a diphthong, we have an approximate.
Those all have to be assigned some symbol.
So, depending on the place and manner of articulation, we assign those symbols.
