The source is aspiration and friction.
How the aspiration is produced?
Suppose you have a tube, you create a narrow constriction in the tube.
Now what will happen?
The air pressure lungs produce an air pressure and you create a narrow constriction constriction using the tongue.
Then what will happen?
The force air try to find out a path and there is a friction kind of noise sound will be generated.
So those kind of sound is called aspiration and friction sound will be generated.
So, details will come in that manner of articulation and that place of articulation discussion.
