amplitude it will be look like this.
So, this is first formant f 1, this is f 2, this is f 3, so on f 4, so on going on.
Once it is going up the amplitude will be going down that will discuss why this is going down.
Now if the voice sound is characterized with the why the formant frequency.
So, formant frequency depends on the structure of the this vocal track.
How this formant frequency will change depending on the h s.
