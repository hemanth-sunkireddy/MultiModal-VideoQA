If I want that that should contain that whole human speech range of frequency, then I should use a very high end microphone whose frequency response may be 15 kilohertz or may be 20 kilohertz.
So, the microphone then the amplifier is also there.
Amplifier frequency response also important.
So, amplifier and microphone whole frequency response should be higher than the my desired what frequency I want to record that.
