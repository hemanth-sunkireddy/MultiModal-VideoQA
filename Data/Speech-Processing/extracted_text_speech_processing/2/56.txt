Now, suppose I have an ADC or volume of the recording volume which is control the ADC level.
So, suppose this is 5 volt to minus 5 volt.
This ADC can handle 5 volt to minus 5 volt.
Now, if I amplify my sound 7 volt to minus 7 volt.
So, suppose 5 volt to minus 5 volt sound wave, sine wave, let us sine wave.
