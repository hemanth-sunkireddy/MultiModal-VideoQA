although my signal to noise ratio is decreases means increases that means i quantization error is decreases but my memory size is increases similarly once i increase the sampling frequency my accuracy of the digital signal will be increases but what is increases size of the file is increases instead of 8 k if it is 16 k that means in one second i have generate 16 k sample if each sample is 8 bit
