So, sampling frequency, based on the sampling frequency you know up to what frequency I can get of this speech signal.
So, that is the sampling frequency idea.
So, in speech sometime we use 16 kilohertz.
That means highest frequency component of the signal is 8 kilohertz.
If it is 22 kilohertz, then it is 11 kilohertz.
So, that is called sampling frequency.
Other aspects is quantization.
