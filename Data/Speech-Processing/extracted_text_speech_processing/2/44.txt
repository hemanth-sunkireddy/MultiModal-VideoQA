it contains whole recording of the sound.
Let us I get this, there is a header.
So, if you see this header, there is a different chunk position has different information.
So, I have to know what is the sampling frequency of the sound and what is the encoded bit of the sound.
If it is 16 bit, that means 2 byte represent one sample.
If it is 8 bit, 8 bit represent one sample.
If it is stereo, all channels are same.
If it is stereo, there are two channel recording is there.
