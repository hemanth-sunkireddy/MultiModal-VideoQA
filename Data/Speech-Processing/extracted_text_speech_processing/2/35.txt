If it is 44 kilohertz, then you can calculate how many samples will be there.
So, instead of 20 second, I can say 30 second.
So, once I say the window size of 40 millisecond, then you know how much sample will be there.
Similarly, if I say if 320 samples I have taken, time domain representation is 20 millisecond.
I can convert.
This will be frequently used in speech processing.
Number of sample to time, time to sample.
So, this is the basic idea of
