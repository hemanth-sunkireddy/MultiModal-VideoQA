amplifier and then microphone amplifier then analog to digital conversion to convert the acoustics wave to a digital signal in this speech.
So, how do you do that?
You know that this is the basic theory.
This is called sampling theory that sampling frequency, this is the complete circuits that this is the normal DSP systems.
So, I can say analog speech do not I am not details with the details of this every blocks.
So, those are the signal processing domain.
