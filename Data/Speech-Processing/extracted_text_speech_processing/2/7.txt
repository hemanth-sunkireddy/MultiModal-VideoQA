to produce the acoustic wave.
Now, sampling frequency analog to digital conversion, sampling frequency is one of the important issue.
So, basically what it is?
It is that may be some of you are there who do not know the digital signal passing or analog to digital conversion.
So, just I explain the very briefly that one.
So, let us x a t is a time domain signal.
What do you mean by time domain signal?
Here is the time and here is the amplitude.
