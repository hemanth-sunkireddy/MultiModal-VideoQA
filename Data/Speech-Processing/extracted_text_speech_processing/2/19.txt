I am restricted the speech signal, but I am interested the speech signal.
So, if it is 20 kilohertz is sampling frequency, so highest frequency of the speech signal is 8 kilohertz.
So, human speech has to be passed to a filter whose highest cutoff frequency is low pass filter is 8 kilohertz.
Above 8 kilohertz, all frequency has what down to 0 or you can say discard almost frequency.
