quantization error.
So, what I am saying that if I recorded the speech signal with a high quantization, the accuracy or quantization error of the signal is reduced.
So, when I am going for a good quality recording, I should use quantization level should be very high instead of 8 bit.
If I use 12 bit or 16 bit, the quantization error is less, but other aspects is there.
What is other aspects?
