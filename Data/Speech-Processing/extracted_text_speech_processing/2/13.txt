some rider or some constraint.
What is those constraints?
It constraints says that if the baseband frequency of this signal is bandwidth is b, baseband or you can say the bandwidth is b means, let the highest frequency component of this signal is f m. If I sample this signal which is f s which must be greater than or equal to 2 f m, this is the rider.
