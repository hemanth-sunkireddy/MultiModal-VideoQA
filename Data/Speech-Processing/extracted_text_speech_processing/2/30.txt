then 16 kilo byte.
So, there is a trade off what quantization level I should use, what kind of sampling frequency I should use.
So, when you record the speech signal suppose you recording the speech signal for telephone speech which is band width is 300 hertz to 3.3 kilo hertz.
So, if it is my signal is band limited to 3.3 kilo hertz I should not sample this signal with a very high frequency.
