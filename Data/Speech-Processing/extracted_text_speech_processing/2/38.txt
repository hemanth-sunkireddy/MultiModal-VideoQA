Also, number of quantization bit and also stereo or mono that I have not discussed details, but most cases in sound recording does in mono.
Since, it is a single channel that I want to record the human voice.
So, when you analyze your voice in computer, you should record the signal in mono format not stereo format.
It is not required because there is no two source are there single source is speaking.
So, it is mono is sufficient same things.
