The acoustic wave contain 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz sound.
Once I put the microphone in the front of the mouth, so microphone has a limitation.
Microphone has one property that it has to be convert this acoustic wave to a electrical signal.
So microphone may have a limitation.
So microphone may have a sensitivity, microphone may have a frequency response.
