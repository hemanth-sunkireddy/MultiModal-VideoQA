there is a loss.
If we compress the sound, I have lost some sound.
So, I cannot recover those signal those sound once I do the decompose it and process the sound sample by sample.
So, if I want to store the just simple recording in sample by sample, use PCMA warp format.
So, there is a PCMA warp format header file, Microsoft PCMA warp format header file.
So, I get the sound file, dot warp format.
This is a binary file.
