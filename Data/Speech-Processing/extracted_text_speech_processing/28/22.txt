Then only I get the exact recorded signal.
If I increase the speed, what will happen?
So suppose there is a 3 second signal is there.
Now I increase the speed.
So suppose if I increase the RPM, so if there is a 5 track is 3 second, now increase the RPM, time will be reduced.
Speed up.
So time will be reduced.
So instead of 3 second sound, I can get 2.5 second sound or less 2 second sound.
