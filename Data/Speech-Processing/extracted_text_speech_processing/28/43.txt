reconstruction is only possible if I suitably choose the window and also the shifting of the window.
So, that is why if you see in any parameter extraction we do the frequency analysis of the speech signal what we done.
So, suppose I have a long speech signal let us this is 4800 sample which is 16 kilohertz sampling rate and 3 second signal.
