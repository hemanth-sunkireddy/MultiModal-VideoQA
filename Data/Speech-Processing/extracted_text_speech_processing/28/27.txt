Suppose I have this is my voicing segment.
Let us I say something and there is a voicing segment.
This voicing segment represent let us this to this represent is let us 1 second.
If I want to match with the lip movement in the video, I have to make it let us 50 instead of 1 second, I have to make it 0.8 second.
So how can I do it?
