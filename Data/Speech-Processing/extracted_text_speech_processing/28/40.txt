is the noise estimation.
So, I can subtract the noise estimation from the signal spectral estimation and I resynthesize it I can get back the signal the noise is removed ok.
So, this way there is a lot of lot of algorithms you can develop.
So, all that there is a algorithm there may be a complex procedure I can find out I can estimate the noise in different way.
