Other is called STFTM synthesis.
To avoid speech synchronous problem, use only the magnitude spectra of the frame.
From the magnitude spectra, it is possible to synthesize the speech signal.
So compute x of n L omega at appropriate frame interval or dissemination rate and appropriate window length.
