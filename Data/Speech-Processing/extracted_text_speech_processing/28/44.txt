So, I have that number of sample.
We have not taken all sample at a time and do the frequency analysis.
What I will do?
We will divide this signal with a frame rate and window length.
So, we choose a window length analysis window N w is equal to let us 20 millisecond.
So, N w is equal to 20 millisecond.
