Pitch synchronous overlap add method.
Details I will discuss these things during the speech synthesis.
P-sola, TDP-sola, ES-nola all we have discussed.
So pitch synchronous overlap add method, then they said if I able to find out the epoch point, the closing and opening point of the vocal fold from the signal, then I can synchronize the pitch.
So I can exactly cut one period.
