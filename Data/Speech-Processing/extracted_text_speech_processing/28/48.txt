understand 5 milliseconds.
So, that is why we are do the speech processing in frame rate.
Then I can do the STFT, I can use the OLA method to get back the signal.
So, I analyze the signal like this way.
If you see there is a picture I have shown you, you can go through this slide also this one.
So, I take frame by frame 70, I can make 75 percent overlap here.
I analyze frame, this frame, this frame, I get back.
