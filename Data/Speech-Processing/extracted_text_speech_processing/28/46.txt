then I shifted the signal that way then take another window from here to here.
So, if it is 10 millisecond is shifting, so this is 10 millisecond, so again 10 to, so this is 10 millisecond, this is 20 millisecond.
So, I can first window is 0 to 20 millisecond.
So, first window, first frame, frame 1 0 to 20 millisecond, second frame 10 to 30 millisecond.
