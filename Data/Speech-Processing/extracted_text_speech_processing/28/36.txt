So, this is l, 2l, 3l, 4l, 5l, 6l.
Now, once I synthesize time, I make the decimation time is l by 2.
So, it is half.
m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 6m.
So, I can say squeeze the number of sample.
So, I can speed up the signal.
If I want to slow down the signal, so instead of half, I can say 2l.
So, it is double.
