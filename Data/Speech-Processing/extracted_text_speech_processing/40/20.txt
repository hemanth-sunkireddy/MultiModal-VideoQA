all words are not explicitly mentioned.
If you find in continuous speech always end of the sentence the amplitude is going down even I have seen many cases in end syllable is not there acoustic signal is not there.
So, this ASER model does not model this speaker mind what or you can say what speaker want to say that is prompted by the input text only.
