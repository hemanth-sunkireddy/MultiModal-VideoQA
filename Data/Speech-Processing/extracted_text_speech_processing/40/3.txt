So, I said I have recorded that acoustical signal, I extracted the parameter as I discussed frame wise either 100 frame per second or 50 frame per second as you wish ok. Now, that is called acoustical measurement.
Then what is ASR?
That from the acoustical measurement I have to predict which word I have spoken understand or not.
