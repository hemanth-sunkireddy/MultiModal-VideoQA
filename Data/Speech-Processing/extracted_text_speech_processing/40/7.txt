Now, probability of a probability of acoustical measurement all the time I taking the acoustical measurement.
So, I can ignore this is not required because all I have all equal the acoustical measurement is there I am not saying I have not measured the acoustical acoustical measurement will be not there, but I have to given that I have to recognize the word.
So, probability a of a I can omit this all is let us say 1.
Now, the maximization problem
