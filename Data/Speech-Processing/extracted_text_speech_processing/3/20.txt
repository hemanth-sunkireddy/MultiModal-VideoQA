signal has amplitude a 1.
So, that can be represented like this way because it is plus 3.
So, minus 3 point there will be a sample whose coefficient amplitude is minus a 3 that is a sample at first sample position 1 2 like that way it is represented.
So, this is the impulse representation of a sequence.
So, if I say I have a speech signal x n who has suppose there is a 100 sample.
Now, if I say the sample start from 0 1 to 100.
So,
