should modify the each input of the signal.
So, that is why whole h k will modify the each input.
So, this is convolution.
How it is done?
It has a operation or how many operation is involved?
It is folding, shifting, multiplication and summation.
If you look at this equation, this is nothing but a folding.
So, if I say x n equal to y equal to 0, then it is nothing but a h k.
