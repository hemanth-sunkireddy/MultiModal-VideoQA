bounded input, bounded output.
In bounded input should produce bounded output, then stable and unstable system.
Then there is recursive and non recursive system that you know that this slide is self exclamatory that explaining that recursive.
If the output depends on the previous output then you call it is a recursive system.
I am not describing details then very much.
