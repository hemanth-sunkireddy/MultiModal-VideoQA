then may be silence, then may be voice.
So, I can say along the time signal changes its property.
So, it is a time varying signal.
Later on you learn that signal parsing algorithms are applied on a stationary signal.
So, I have to consider how I make the speech signal is non stationary.
So, those kind of consideration we will take.
So, this is stationary and non stationary signal.
Then I come to the systems.
