So, this is my system diagram.
So, this is y n and this is x n. So, signal flow is this way sorry this way this way or not.
So, discrete system can be implemented like this way.
So, z to the power minus 1 is nothing but a single sample display.
Now, a system consists of certain properties.
I will come implementation later on also.
