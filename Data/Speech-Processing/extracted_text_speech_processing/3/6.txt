then what should be the x n?
x n is a digital signal.
So, x n is nothing but a cos instead of continuous omega we write this omega n plus theta.
This is called discrete frequency.
So, this is continuous radian per second and this is that this is this is this frequency is per sample I will come details I will come.
So, this is written like this way.
