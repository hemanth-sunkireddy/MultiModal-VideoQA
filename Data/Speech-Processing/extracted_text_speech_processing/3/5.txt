means the number of oscillations or number of period per second will be increases.
So, high frequency means oscillations will be increases.
So, that is the property.
So, more period are included in one second, more period are included in time.
So, this is the low frequency and this is the high frequency signal.
So, this is the concept of analog signal.
Now, once I make the digital signal, let us this cos omega t I sampled and stored it is a digital signal.
So, if it is a continuous if x at is a continuous signal.
