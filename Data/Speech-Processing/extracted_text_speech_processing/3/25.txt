sinusoidal of 500 hertz.
Let this is a 500 hertz sinusoidal.
If I take this time, if I take this time, all the time it is 500 hertz sinusoidal.
So, I can say the signal is a stationary signal.
It does not change its property along the time.
Now, say the speech signal.
If I say speech signal, if I say a sentence along the time, the signal properties varies.
Sometime it is silent, sometime it is voice, sometime it is silent, sometime it is friction.
