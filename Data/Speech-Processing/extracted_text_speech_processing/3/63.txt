it is easy to manipulate powerful processing capability characterized completely by their response to unit sample by a convolutional relationship basis of linear filtering use model for speech production use as a model for speech production.
So, always we try to model this one in a LTI system because it is easy to understand signal processing respect it is easy to understand it is easy to manipulate it powerful processing capability.
So, that is why we always use
