So, I just quickly go through the some DSP concept.
So, what I will discuss I am not discuss the details mathematics I will discuss concept behind that DSP algorithm ok.
So, let us start with that continuous signal.
So, if I if you know that this omega always represent that continuous frequency this omega ok.
So, if I say sinusoidal signal let us say A is the amplitude cos omega t plus theta theta is the phase.
