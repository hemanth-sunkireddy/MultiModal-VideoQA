Now, what is my y?
So, this is less y n. So, at y 0, y 0 this multiply this and if I say this side if I projected this side it is 0, here it is also 0, here it is also 0, here it is 0.
So, here also it is 0.
So, product this multiply with this, sum with this multiply with this, sum with this will multiply with this.
