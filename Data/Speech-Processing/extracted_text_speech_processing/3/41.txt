or you can say the most commonly used signal processing algorithm in speech is called convolution.
So convolution is the most frequently used.
If you see that if I want to find out a output for a input in a system, then the system transfer function is convolved with the input to produce the output of the system.
So, convolution is most commonly used algorithm in DSP.
