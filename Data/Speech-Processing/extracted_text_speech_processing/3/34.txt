that is called stationary and non stationary signal, but if it is time variant and time invariant system.
So, if the system does not change its property over the time then I call it is a time invariant system.
If it is change along with the time then I can say it is a time variant system.
If I consider this vocal tract is a system along the time it change its construction.
So, it is a time varying system.
