I write this one, this frequency of this cos this digital signal is 500 R. So, let us this is denoted by F. So, this denoted by capital F. So, F by F s small f is nothing but a frequency of the signal that is analog frequency divided by F s. So, I cannot say that this is a if it is periodic if this is a rational number then only it will be periodic.
