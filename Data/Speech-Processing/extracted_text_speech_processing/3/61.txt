So, that is the correlation.
So, details there may be a detailed discussion in signal passing books you can refer to the any signal passing book.
The algorithm also I have written down you can go through the slides and find out that things then the convolution correlation.
So, then LTI discrete time system which has to consider because in signal passing or speech digital speech passing.
