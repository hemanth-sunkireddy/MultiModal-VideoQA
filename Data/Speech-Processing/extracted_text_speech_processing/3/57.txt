Circular convolution of x n and h n is defined as the convolution of h n with a periodic signal x p n. If the signal is periodic then I can do a circular convolution.
So, this is the mathematics I am not going details of the circular convolution.
Next correlation, correlation is similar mathematics with the convolution.
What I want?
Suppose I want to find out there is a signal like this and there is a signal like this.
