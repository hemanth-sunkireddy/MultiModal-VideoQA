A system has certain property.
What are the property?
It is may be statics or it may be dynamic system.
A discrete system is called statics or memoryless if its output at any instant n depend at most on the input sample at the same time, but not past or future sample of the input.
So, suppose my y n is only depends on x n and x n minus y n.
