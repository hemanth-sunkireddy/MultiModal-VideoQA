but not the future input.
Future input will be x n plus 1.
If it is not depend on x n plus 1, then I call it is a causal system.
If it is depend, then it is a non-causal system.
Then stable system, unstable system.
What is stability?
If I apply a bounded input to input to the system, it should produce bounded output.
If I apply a bounded input, if the system produce bounded output, then I call system is stable system, B I B O.
