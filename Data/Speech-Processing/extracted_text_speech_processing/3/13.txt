but if you see small f can varies only minus half to plus half and small omega what is the value of omega?
Omega is nothing but a 2 pi f. So, f is nothing but a minus f minus half to plus half.
So, I can say omega can vary only from minus pi to plus pi where f is the sampling frequency.
So, small omega represent the discrete frequency.
