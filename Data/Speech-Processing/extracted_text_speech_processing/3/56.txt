this will be third sample 1 2 3 4.
So, this sample again become 0.
Now, I product this will this, this will this, this will this, this will this, this will this, this will this and add together and get the Y n. So, that way I get whole Y n. So, that is why I am holding shifting product and sum.
So, convolution.
Then there is a term called circular convolution.
