ok.
So, this omega is continuous frequency ok. Now, what are the property?
If you change this the frequency at this things if it is 500 hertz sinusoidal then it a frequency is 500 hertz.
If you increase the frequency in time domain suppose if it is if it is like this.
So, what you say ok this has an oscillation.
So, the number of period in per second give me the frequency ok.
So, this there is a oscillation is there.
Now, if I increase the frequency what will happen?
