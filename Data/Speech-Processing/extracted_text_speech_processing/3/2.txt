the to conceptualize those DSP problem.
So, what I do that I will just review some DSP concept, but details I will not go because details this is a separate subject which is called digital signal parsing because this is the best point of knowing the digital speech parsing.
So, whatever the acoustic phonetics speech production you know that is different because that does not require any DSP concept that much, but once I explain start that explaining the digital speech processing and modeling discrete modeling discrete time modeling.
So, in that cases some DSP concept is required.
