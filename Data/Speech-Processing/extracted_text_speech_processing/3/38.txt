So, if the system is linear and time invariant, then we called LTI system, linear time invariant system, that is called LTI system.
That means, the system is linear, system does not change its property along the time.
Then you know causal and non-causal system.
So, if it is not depends on the future, then I call system is a causal system.
Means, Y n is only depends on either X n or X n minus 1.
