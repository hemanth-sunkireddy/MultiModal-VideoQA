And what is the property?
Now, a discrete time signal is periodic if its frequency f is rational number.
What do you understand?
What is where the small f is come?
Now, what is omega?
Omega is nothing but a 2 pi f. Now, if it is digitized signal what I have done?
I have replaced this t by n into capital T. So, this omega continuous frequency omega is nothing but a 2 pi f.
