2 that signal.
So, I can say if it is frame rate is 10 millisecond, then I can say overlap signal.
So, first window may be I taken 160 sample, then shifted the window by 80 sample and I take the window from here to here.
So, let us this is my nth window, where I take m equal to 0 my window length is l. So, outside the window length, I consider the signal is 0 there is a no signal.
