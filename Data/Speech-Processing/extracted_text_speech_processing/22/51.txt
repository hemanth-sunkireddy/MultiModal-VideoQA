So, symmetric with all diagonal elements are equal.
So, matrix equation solve using then I can apply the Levinson Durbin algorithm to solve this matrix equation.
So, next class we try to discuss how you want to solve this matrix equation.
So, if you see that R n I have established here that R n is nothing, but a autocorrelation ok.
