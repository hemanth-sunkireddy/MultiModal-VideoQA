nothing I can predict.
So, total signal total sample itself is the error.
So, I can say that at the beginning of the prediction the prediction error will be maximum.
If I see the error signal at the beginning of the prediction, prediction error will be maximum.
Because if I say here my window is started this is my sample and outside the window signal is 0.
So, because those samples are not there.
