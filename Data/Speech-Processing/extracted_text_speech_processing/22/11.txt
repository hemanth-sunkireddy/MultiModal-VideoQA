So, I can say i and k both are 0.
So, both are 0 I can write minus k equal to 1 2 p alpha k phi of 0 k i is 0 and k is there phi of 0 k. So, I can say E n is nothing, but a phi of 0 k is there phi of 0 k is there.
So, I can write k equal to 1 2 p alpha k is there phi of 0 k is there phi of 0 k is there.
So, I can write k equal to 1 2 p alpha k is there
