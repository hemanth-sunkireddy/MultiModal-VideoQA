if it is capital R is this matrix into alpha is equal to R. So, alpha is equal to so if the capital R is the matrix and R into alpha is equal to small r if it is this is called small r matrix then I can say alpha is equal to capital R inverse smaller I can solve.
So, all diagonal element if you see the R n 0.
So, this has a special type of matrix.
