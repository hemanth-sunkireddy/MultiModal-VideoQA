I forcefully make them 0 by windowing.
So, once make them 0, I am estimating the first sample from the all 0 sample.
So, I get the estimation 0.
So, error the error is the sample 1.
Take the next sample.
I am estimating the next sample from previous p sample where only one sample is there which is S n minus 1 is non-zero.
So, my prediction will be alpha 1 into
