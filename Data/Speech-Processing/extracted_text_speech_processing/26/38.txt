Fourier transform.
So, omega is continuous.
Now, I want to make omega is discrete.
So, how the omega becomes discrete?
Omega is continuous in the frequency plane.
So, what I do?
Let us I have a frequency scale.
I have a DFT, DTFT, DFT discrete Fourier transform.
Then, the length of the discrete Fourier transform is involved.
So, DFT length, if you remember the review of the DSP, there is a n is called.
