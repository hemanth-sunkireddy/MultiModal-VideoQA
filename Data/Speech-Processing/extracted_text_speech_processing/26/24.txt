less it is infinite to infinite digital signal less it is infinite to infinite or 0 to 4800 in case of real signal.
So, if it is infinite to infinite then I can say x m x n omega x n omega I want to find out the frequency response of this portion.
So, this portion is 1 2 3.
So, this is n I can say this is n n equal to 1 n equal to 2 n equal to 3 this n will
