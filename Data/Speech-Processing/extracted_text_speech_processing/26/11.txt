if I take the phase only then it is called phase spectra.
So, if I take the time this axis is the magnitude this axis is the frequency and y axis is the magnitude of discrete Fourier transform then I call this is a magnitude spectra ok.
If I take the phase of phase so x k is nothing but in the form of a plus j b.
So, what is the magnitude spectra root over of a square plus b square.
