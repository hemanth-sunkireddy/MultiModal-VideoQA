will be with the window or will be with the signal.
So, if it is this one then I call time origin is with the with the signal because m is varies infinite m series m is varies and x m is varies infinite.
So, time origin with the signal itself that is why window is flat back and cut the signal.
Now, if the time origin tied with the window then the same things I can write x n omega is equal to.
So, time origin with the window
