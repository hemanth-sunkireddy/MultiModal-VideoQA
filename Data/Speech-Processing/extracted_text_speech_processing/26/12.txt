if it is phase spectra theta is equal to tan inverse b by a.
So, if I plot the theta against the frequency if this is the frequency axis and this axis is the theta then I call this is a phase spectra.
So, frequency analysis we find out two kinds of spectra one is called phase spectra another one is called magnitude spectra.
If you see if I analyze it if I analyze it frequency analysis if you see this window.
