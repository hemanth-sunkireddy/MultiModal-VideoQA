with 16 bit.
So, each sample is encoded with 16 bit and sampling frequency is 16 kilohertz.
Suppose I record a sentence which is 3 second long.
So, if it is sentence is 3 second long how many sample will be there 3 into 16 k sample.
So, 48 k sample will be there.
So, 8000 sample will be there.
If I take whole signal at a time do the frequency analysis.
