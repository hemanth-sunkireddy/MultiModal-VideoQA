Once I get 1 k, if I take the mod then I get the amplitude spectra.
So, this amplitude is decoded into a scale which scale color scale what is the color if it is black if I say if it is black then intensity is maximum.
So, let us maximum is 1 if it is intensity is maximum max max intensity is black and if it is white then it is intensity is mean mean intensity is.
