So, if it is a 16 kilohertz signal and length of the DFT is length of the DFT is 1000, then I can say each of the segment is 16 hertz.
So, it is 0 to 16 hertz 16 to 32 hertz.
So, each of the segment is 16 hertz which is twice pi by n nothing, but a F s by n. So, I can say I can divide this omega with respect to.
