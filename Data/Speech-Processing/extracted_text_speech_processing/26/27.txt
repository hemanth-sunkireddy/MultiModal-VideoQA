So, once I cut it means I am multiplying a rectangular window of l length.
So, suppose this is my rectangular window.
So, what I am doing I inversing the time of the window this side and cut the signal.

So, n minus m number of signal I cut and multiply it ok.
So, what is this?
This is nothing, but a.
