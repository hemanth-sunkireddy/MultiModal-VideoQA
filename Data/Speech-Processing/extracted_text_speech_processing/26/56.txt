band.
So, this is called spectra, spectrogram plot.
How do you plot the spectrogram?
So, depending on the intensity or the particular frequency component, the color will come and the band is called band resolution.
So, that is all come resolution trade off.
So, 2 pi by n or F s by n is nothing but a resolution of that particular band.
So, this is the STFT analysis.
