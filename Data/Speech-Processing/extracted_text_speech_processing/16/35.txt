intensity intensity and of a acoustics wave I can easily measure you can know I is equal to nothing but a p square by 2 rho c rho and c is the density and c is the velocity of the sound rho p is the pressure wave amplitude of the pressure wave then I can say intensity is nothing but a p square by 2 rho c. So, I can measure the sound intensity you can say the sound intensity measure my decibel I will come d b meter.
