by the ear.
So, we have ear.
So, function of the ear to convert that input acoustic signal to the neural signal that is the process.
Then neural transduction step take place between the output of the inner ear and neural pathway that means whatever the output is coming from the neural transduction has to be taken away to the processing unit and nerve firing signal.
So, auditor there is a human brain.
So, brain process that firing signal.
