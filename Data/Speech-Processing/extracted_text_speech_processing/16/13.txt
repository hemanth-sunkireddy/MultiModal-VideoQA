is the important point.
So, that means, how efficiently a microphone convert the acoustical signal to electrical signal is the property or is the you can say the construction depends on the construction mechanism of the microphone.
Similarly, human being has an ear, two ear if you say two ears.
So, how efficiently human ear can convert the input acoustical signal to the output.
