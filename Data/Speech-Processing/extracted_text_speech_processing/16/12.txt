signal to a electrical signal ok. Now, I have to know that ok this microphone has the how efficiently this microphone can convert the acoustical signal to electrical signal or I can say the properties of acoustical signal how accurately impose on electrical signal that is the electrical.
So, acoustical signal is equivalent to electrical signal if the all properties of acoustical signal like that its frequency repaint or you can say frequency composition or its amplitude all things how it is represent in electrical signal.
