10 kilohertz, but other frequency the conversion from acoustical signal to electrical signal is very low either very low or almost 0.
Similarly, human ear is not sensitive or intensity sensitive to all frequency equally.
So, the may be here is 1 kilohertz may be after 5 kilohertz it also increasing.
So, 5 dB of 100 hertz, 5 dB of 2 kilohertz the intensity perception by the human being.
