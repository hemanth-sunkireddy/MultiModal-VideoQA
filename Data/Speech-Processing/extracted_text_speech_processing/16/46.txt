the sound will be less, but if it is there then it acts on mechanical resonator then it is the sound is larger.
So, that is the effect in here also that is this acts on mechanical kind of things and that transfer the sound to the cochlea.

Now, cochlea so I am not reading the slide you can read the slide.
So, inner ear is the cochlea.
So, this is the semicircular canal and there is a cochlea.
