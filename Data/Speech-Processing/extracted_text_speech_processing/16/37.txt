The perception of loudness is human perception, but intensity is a physical parameter.
So, perception, so there is two dimension, one is called physical dimension, where I can directly measure the quantity, measure the parameters, directly measure the parameter, velocity, frequency, all are directly measurable.
But if I say loudness is a human behavior, physiological behavior of a human.
