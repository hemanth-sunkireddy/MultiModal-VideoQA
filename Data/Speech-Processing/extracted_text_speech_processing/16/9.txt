one is called acoustical to neural converter, neural transduction and neural processing.
So, acoustical signal has to be converted to the neuron signal, neural converter and neural transduction, neuron has to be transmit the signal from the conversion point to the central brain for processing.
So, here if you see the acoustical to this transversion, the acoustical signal first convert to neural representation.
