which is lie between 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz.
If I apply 22 kilohertz to the human ear it will not perceive it might may not be converted to nervous system or nervous system cannot represent or cannot sensitize a response in the human brain.
So, I have to know how this signal or how this acoustical signal is converted to normal signal.
So, that is the physiological mechanism we have to understand the physiological mechanism.
