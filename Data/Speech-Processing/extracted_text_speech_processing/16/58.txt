that convert that acoustical signal to a mechanical vibration and that mechanical vibration transferred to the cochlear.
Inside the cochlear, there is a basilar membrane.
So, this is apex and this is the beginning.
So, this is the beginning of the cochlear, this is the apex of the cochlear.
So, inside the cochlear, there is a basilar membrane which is responsible for speech conversion of that mechanical motion to normal signal.
