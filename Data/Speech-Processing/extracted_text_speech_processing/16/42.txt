it increase the panna area.
So, more acoustical signal is channelized to there.
Some if you see the rabbits to listen the sound rabbit can move his panna, we cannot move my panna.
So, that is why we have a head movement.
So, I once I want to listen the sound I can listen I can rotate the head, but if you see the rabbit can rotate their panna to the direction of the sound.
So, the panna work is that it should channelize the acoustical wave.
