So, sound localization is one of the major issues because human has a two ears that is why we can localize the sound.
Second one is the focus attention on a particular sound or you can say the noise cancellation.
If you understand if you study the radar signal processing in electronics you know the how the clutter noise is rejected or kind of things.
So, if I have two ears help human being to attention or focus on a particular sound.
