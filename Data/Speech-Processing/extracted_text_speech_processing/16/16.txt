it is 30 hertz to 10 kilohertz.
So, that is data set is given that this is the microphone.
So, this microphone is efficient to convert the acoustical signal in between 30 hertz to 10 kilohertz and produce the electrical signal.
So, if an acoustical signal consist of 12 kilohertz, the electrical signal should not contain that component because that micro the response of the microphone at 12 kilohertz is almost 0.
