0.5 dB not less than 0.2 dB and 1 kilohertz sound of 0.5 dB will be the same response because it is amplify or you can say that amplification of the power or I say the or all frequency by the outer ear is not same.
Similarly, amplification or you can say the frequency response of the middle ear is not flat throughout the frequency, it also different frequency is a different response.
