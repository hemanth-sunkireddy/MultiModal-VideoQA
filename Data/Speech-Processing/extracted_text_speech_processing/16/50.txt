Now, in engineering model, so I should know what kind of action or what kind of things is happen in PINA that is outer ear and what kind of response is happen in the middle ear and the finally, the inner ear.
So, if I see the frequency response of the outer ear that is the PINA.
So, PINA if you see that it is not channelize all frequency same amplitude.
