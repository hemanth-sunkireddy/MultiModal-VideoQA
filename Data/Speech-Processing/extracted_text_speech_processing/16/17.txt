maybe almost 0 let us it is down in here is 12 kilohertz.
So, it is 0 almost 0.
So, I cannot get 12 kilohertz response in here.
So, that means, the limitation which is imposed by the microphone in electrical signal is 30 hertz to 10 kilohertz.
Similarly, suppose I have a human ear.
So, acoustical signal human ear convert into normal signal.
So, perception of that signal that how we perceive what is the limitation of our.
