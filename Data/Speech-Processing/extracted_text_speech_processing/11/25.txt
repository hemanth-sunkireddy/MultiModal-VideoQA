and bandwidth is introduced and bandwidth in the low frequency are much more.
Then if I say the Vesca's law, friction laws consider then again the bandwidth is increased the bandwidth and slightly decrease the formant frequency, it slightly increase the formant frequency.
So, increase decrease if I cancel out I can say the formant frequency is around whatever 500 as I have get here, but bandwidth is here, here is 0 bandwidth.
Now if I consider the radiation laws.
