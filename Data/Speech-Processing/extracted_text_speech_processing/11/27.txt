will be multiplied with the V omega Z r omega is 1 or no effect if omega is very low if Z r omega is sorry if the omega is low radiation effect is not negligible if it is Z r omega is omega is very high then there is a lot of attenuation in the high frequency.
So, frequency response of the Z r omega is nothing but like this this taper high if the frequency increases loss is increases.
