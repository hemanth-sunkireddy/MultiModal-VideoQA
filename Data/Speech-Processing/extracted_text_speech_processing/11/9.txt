slightly higher frequency the frequency will be instead of 500 hertz it may be 500 and 5 hertz slightly frequency shifted towards the higher frequency side most effected in the lower band lower frequency will be the most.
So, lower frequency bandwidth will be increased more compared to the higher frequency.
So, most effected is the lower band.
Now, if I consider
