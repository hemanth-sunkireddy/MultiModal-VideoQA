then this will be like this.
Then again if I 1, 2, 3 if I consider and then the wave equation instead of 2 wave wave equation with this 3 equation will derive and from that 3 equation I get an analytical solution of what will happen in the frequency response which is V a omega U l omega divided by U g omega.
Now they said if the length of the tube is 17.5 centimeter and 5 centimeter square is the cross sectional area.
