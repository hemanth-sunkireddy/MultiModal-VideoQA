2.5 kilohertz like that it is said that complex pole with non zero bandwidth.
So, here it is zero bandwidth here it is zero bandwidth bandwidth is zero in loss less condition.
Now if I introduce the loss what will happen then instead of zero bandwidth some bandwidth will be generated.
So, the poles are complex with non zero bandwidth.
