just closing the valve means I am closing the hole in the tube.
So, if I put a hole here you know the frequency response is changed the tube frequency response will be changed.
Now in case of our case in vocal track also there is a nozzle coupling in here.
So, once the valium is open so nozzle coupling is coupled with the oral track, tube structure is changed the frequency response will be changed.
So, sound pressure the same as at the input of each tube the volume velocity is the sum of the volume velocity at the input to nozzle and
