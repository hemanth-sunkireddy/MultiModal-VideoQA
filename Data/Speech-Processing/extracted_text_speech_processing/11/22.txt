radiation load does not affect the frequency response of the acoustical tube.
So, low frequency are less affected.
Now, if I say J omega or omega L r is much greater than R r at high frequency much much greater than R r then I can say it is nothing it is nothing but a R r J omega L J omega L cancel.
