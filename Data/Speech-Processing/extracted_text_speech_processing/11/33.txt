oral cavity.
So, close oral cavity can trap energy at certain frequency preventing those frequency from appearing in the nozzle output.
So, if you think about why I am producing a nozzle consonant or nozzle sound if my oral cavity is totally closed then the air is coming through the nozzle.
Now, if the oral cavity is not totally closed then the nozzle and oral both cavity are.
So, if I consider the nozzle sound is coming in this path then some pressure will be trapped by this oral cavity.
