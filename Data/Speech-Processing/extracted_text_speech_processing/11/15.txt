So, now if you see the assume that P L T is equal to 0 at lift this is the we have assume the acoustical analog a short circuit the output where you couple this thing if I say transmission line I said the output is totally short circuit T is equal to 0 T means the voltage is equal to 0.
So, output is short circuit here I said there is a no load no acoustic load.
So, it is loaded 0 output is short circuit it is ideal condition.
