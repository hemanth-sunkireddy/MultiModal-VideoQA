Then if you see high frequency or resistive radiation, so this circuit this will be suppressed.
So radiation loss due to the radiation loss high frequency components amplitude will be decreased.
Now if you see that also here also then in mathematics H j omega transfer function of the tube is nothing but a P l omega divided by U g omega which is P l omega U l omega.
So it is nothing but a Z r omega.
