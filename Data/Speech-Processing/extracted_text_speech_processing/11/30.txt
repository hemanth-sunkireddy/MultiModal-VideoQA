and radiation.
The bandwidth of the two lowest resonance depend primarily on the vocal track wall losses f 1 and f 2 and the bandwidth of the highest resonance depend the highest frequency resonance depend primarily on the viscous friction loss, thermal loss and radiation loss.
Because if you see I said the bandwidth is most affected frequency or low frequency in case of wall variation in the wall.
In case of viscous low high frequency bandwidth are introduced.
