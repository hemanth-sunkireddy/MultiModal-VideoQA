then I can say n is equal to 512.
If it is 512, this is the resolution.
So, now resolution curve 512.
So, resolution is increases.
What is the resolution?
Resolution means this is a frequency scale.
If I divide this long window, so that resolution is less.
If I want to increase the resolution, the division has to be very small size.
So, 2 pi by n value.
