at particular frequency.
This is the modulation, modulation means multiplication.
Then it has to be passed through a system whose filter impulse response is W n and I get the output which is x of fixed time for a particular frequency response.
So, if I draw the whole frequency response, suppose the baseband signal, I delete this one.
