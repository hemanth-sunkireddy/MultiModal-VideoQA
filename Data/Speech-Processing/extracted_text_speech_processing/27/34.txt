x n that is the synthesis portion.
So, if I remove it if you see if I remove it that same those inputs are going there and some kind of inverse transform is taken care and that inverse transform is written here.
I will discuss the details in inverse transform and then I get the x n back if omega 0 w 0 is not 0.
