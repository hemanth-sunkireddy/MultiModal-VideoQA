So, the effect of the window will be always there once I multiply by the window.
So, the frequency response is not the exact frequency response of the signal.
So, it is the frequency response of the main lobe multiplied by the side lobe.
So, what I want I want to increase the main lobe should be flat.
Ideally if the main lobe is flat then the side lobe effect of side lobe it is negligible.
