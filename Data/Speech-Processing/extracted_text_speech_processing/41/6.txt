So, I want to use the computer because English is a second language that English is not their mother tongue.
So, if I want to taught the second language or English spoken language in every school can we developed a e-learning tools or e-learning platform by which we can taught all the school children English pronunciation because if the pronunciation is not correct then you see the spelling mistakes will be happen.
So, spelling and pronunciation orality and because the orality is first if you if you read the history.
