that the government of West Bengal decided that English will be taught from primary level.
Earlier it was started from class 5 or 6.
Now, it is decided that English can be taught from class 2 or 3 level.
Now, if you visited many schools in village area, you see the pronunciation are different.
The teacher's pronunciation is not also not acceptable.
So, if I want to spread the spoken English or I want to spread English literacy in village area.
