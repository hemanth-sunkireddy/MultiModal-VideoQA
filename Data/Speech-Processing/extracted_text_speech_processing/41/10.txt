So, like that music listening or you can say that acquiring of music from a guru that you use you sing a song then guru says no no no your upper node is not touching that is guru's perceptual judgment.
Now I replacing that guru by a computer, computer judging I pronounce zoo initially pronounce zoo computer say no no no it is a zoo then I say zoo no no no still it is zoo then I can say zoo is achieved.
So, that is one of that.
