So, these two equation we have derived.
Now, if I have not predict anything what is E 0 M?
What is E 0 M?
E 0 M means that what is error?
Error is that sample value minus estimated value.
So, if order is 0 that means I am not estimating anything.
So, error is nothing but a SN.
So, similarly backward error.
