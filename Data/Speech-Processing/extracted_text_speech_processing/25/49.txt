What is the what is the k parameter?
How do we calculate the k parameter?
So, can we actually minimize the error?
So, if I say I am not writing in a board if you see in the slides if you see in the slides k forward.
So, e forward prediction error mean square forward prediction error is this one.
So, you know that e i m can be written as e i minus 1 m minus k i into b i minus 1 m minus 1 that whole square.
