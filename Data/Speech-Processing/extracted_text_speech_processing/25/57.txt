those represent the transfer function at that position and each each pole if it is those are represented the pole position equivalence to the pole.
So, each pole represent the formant frequency.
So, actually alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3 should represent the formant frequency is the frequency plane.
Now, if I take 14th order then the alpha value which is not close to unit circle not give you the formant frequency.
