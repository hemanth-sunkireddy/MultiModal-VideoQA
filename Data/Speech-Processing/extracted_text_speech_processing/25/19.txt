from this point to this point.
So, my bit rate is 160 byte I have to transmit it.
I have to transmit it 160 byte from this point to this point.
Can I reduce it using this LPC method?
So, instead of transmitting 20 millisecond.
So, since it is 8 kilohertz what should be the order of the prediction?
So, for F s is equal to 8 kilohertz.
So, I can say F s by 1000.
