how do you minimize?
I differentiate with respect to K i and equal to 0.
So, check the differentiation and find out the K i forward value.
I can find out the K i forward value.
Once I get the K i forward value, similarly I can calculate the K i value for backward error.
Then I can say the K is called per-care partial reflection coefficient or partial correlation coefficient.
