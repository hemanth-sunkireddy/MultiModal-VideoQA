which will input to the second tube is nothing but a volume velocity which is exited from the first tube.
So, the volume velocity which is exited from the kth tube will be the volume velocity which is the input of the k plus 1 tube.
So, I can say u kth tube volume output volume velocity is nothing but a u k plus t minus tau k.
