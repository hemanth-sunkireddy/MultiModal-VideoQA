If I consider all tubes are equal length, then what should be the diagram?
So, I said this delay tau k, tau k is equal to tau k plus 1, if all tube length are, so what is tau k?
L k by c, so if all tube length are same, then I can say the tau k is equal to tau k plus 1, all are del x del x del x del x del x.
So, delay circuit will be same.
