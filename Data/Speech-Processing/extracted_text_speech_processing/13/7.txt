There will be an effect at junction also.
So, the main purpose for multiple tube modeling is that I have to find out what happening at each and every junction of the tube.
So, the cross section let us this one is very small cross sectional area this is wide cross sectional area.
So, what will happen volume velocity and pressure wave equation in this junction what will happen all tube will be connected here this junction.
So, let us I want to know what will happen at k th junction.
