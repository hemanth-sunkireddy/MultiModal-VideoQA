I will get from the condition.
So, I said that if it is the my first tube and it if it is the kth tube and if it is the k plus 1 tube red one is the k plus 1 tube.
So, the volume velocity which is inject at the output of the kth tube will be the equal volume velocity at the input of the red tube.
Similarly, the output pressure of the black tube is equivalent to the output pressure of the red tube that is why I make ok.
If it is that.
