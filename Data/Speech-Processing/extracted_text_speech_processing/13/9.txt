and this is the kth tube this is the junction.
So, here if it is L k then here L this if I see this is a beginning of the kth tube.
So, x equal to 0 and here it is x equal to L k ok.
Here will be another junction.
So, I the let us solve for the single junction this will be replicated at every junction.
So, cross sectional area of this tube is a k this tube is a k plus.
