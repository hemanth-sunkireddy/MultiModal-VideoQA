So, it is nothing but a mechanical oscillation.
So, a mechanical body is vibrating and sound is acoustics wave is generated.
Now, vibration of mechanical body require external force.
I require a force to vibrate the body.
Now, if you see if I have a membrane connect a membrane if I pass the air very thin membrane is closed and if I pass air in force the membrane will vibrate.
