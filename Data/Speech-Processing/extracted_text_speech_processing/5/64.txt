the fundamental frequency much more higher because the length of the vocal cord is much shorter and the formant frequency will be higher because the length of the vocal cord is shorter so i can say that formant frequency depends on length of the vocal tract and also other some properties we will discuss later on when we model this vocal tract so if the length is increases the formant frequency will be different so i can say
