but the impulse response contain all the fundamental frequency all the frequency less same height and this is the you can say time and this is the frequency sorry this is the this is the this is the frequency and this is the power this is the frequency this is the power so as per the signal processing model when the source is passes through a filter source that signal will convolve with the filter signal
