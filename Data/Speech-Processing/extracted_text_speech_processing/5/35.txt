lungs ok and that is u g if you see the u g mechanical oscillation produce the acoustics wave so acoustics wave has a volume velocity and is a pressure wave it has a volume velocity ok so it is a volume velocity u g particle velocity and from you can multiply for fixed unit fixed volume is a volume velocity ok now u g
