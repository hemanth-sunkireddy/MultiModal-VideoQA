We have a tongue, tongue separate the cavity in two part, one is called back cavity, one is the front cavity.
And we have a vellum, if you see the vellum either vellum can be closed or vellum can be open.
If vellum is open and oral cavity is closed, then the air will passes through the nose, so nasal cavity is involved.
If the vellum is closed, the sound is only passed through the mouth that is called mouth.
