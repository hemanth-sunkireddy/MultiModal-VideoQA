If the vocal cords are closed then the vibration will produce and that vibration create the sound and that sound is modified depending on the tube structure when it passes through the tube.
So I can say in human speech production system has a two part, one is the source here the source of sound is vocal cords and lungs only the provide the pressure.
So one is the source.
