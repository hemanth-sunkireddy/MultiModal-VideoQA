Now, if you record a speech and if you just display the speech it will look like this if you see here this portion I have not spoken anything this portion let us I started spoken this is called unvoiced sound some noisy sound may be there then there is a voice sound is generated.
So, normally in speech I can three part one is silence one is unvoiced another one is a voiced.
So, silence means when I am not taking anything nothing is coming out from the mouth.
