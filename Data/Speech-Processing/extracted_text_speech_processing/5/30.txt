if it is closed voiced if it is slightly if it is open but the tube can produce a noise kind of sound that is called unvoiced sound ok.
So, unvoiced voiced and silence region I have seen in the first slides in here.
Now, if I see the glottal flow how the air is flow in the glottis.
So, once the vocal cord is closed if the vocal cord is closed no air can flow.
So, either it is gradually open.
