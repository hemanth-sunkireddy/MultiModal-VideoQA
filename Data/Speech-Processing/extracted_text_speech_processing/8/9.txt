What are the frequency content in this signal?
So I say my y axis is the frequency, my x axis is the let us x axis is the frequency and I want to know the each frequency content amplitude.
So then the power of every single frequency.
So this is a two dimensional plot frequency versus power.
This is also time versus sample amplitude.
Now the problem is that if I plot this way.
