So, this portion is silence, this portion is fricative, if I say it I can zoom out this is fricative, this portion is voiced.
So it may contain voice consonant, it may contain vocalic sound, vowel, it may contain diphthong, it may contain semi vowel, I do not know, but it contains some vocalic sound.
So, vocalic sound look like this.
Again if I say showing this spectrogram I ask you.
