So, I can say here to here is nothing but a consonant to vowel transition.
That part vowels is steady state part called vowel steady state.
Then again it will start from steady state to consonant transition.
So, by seeing a waveform or by seeing a spectrogram, if you see the formant structure, I am not showing you the formant because this time I am not introducing the formant here to see the formant in spectrogram.
Later on I can show you.
