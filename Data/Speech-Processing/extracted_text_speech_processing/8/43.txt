whether it is a to whether it is a co but I can say yes it is a unvoiced unaspirated flossing okay.
So at least manner I can say.
So if you look like the record your different kind of consonant with vowel and look like what kind of it is look so you can see the look but if you closely watch the spectrogram then you find in case of retroflex the formant movement that will be a formant structure.
Here I cannot show you but in part it is possible to draw the formant also if you see the formant movement will be different.
