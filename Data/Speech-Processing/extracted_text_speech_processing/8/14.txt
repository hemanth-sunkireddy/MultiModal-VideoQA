generated those kind of random noise if I say fricative or if I say aspiration.
So if it is fricative that means friction noise will be there.
So I can easily say this is nothing but a fricative.
Now if I see here there is no power at all in the frequency.
If you see there is no power at all.
So if you see the time domain this is zero sample level.
So that means this portion is silence.
