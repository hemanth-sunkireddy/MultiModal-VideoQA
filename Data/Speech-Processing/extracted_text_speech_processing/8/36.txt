Tongue movement from A to TA and TA to A is different from KA to A and KA to A to KO.
So it is one is the velar opening, velar closure, another is the tip of the tongue touches the tip to produce the TO.
So cavity structure will be different that time.
So seeing the spectrogram I can at least say what kind of manner of that consonant.
So this is KO.
