I can say what kind of consonant it is.
If you see the retroflex, I do not know why the retroflex is this may be then that may be I think so if it is I do not know it may be Tau.
So, Tau.
So, see that again there is a vast unversed occlusion.
So, I seeing this spectrum waveform I cannot say whether it is a Tau or not.
