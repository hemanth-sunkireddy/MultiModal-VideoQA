then also I have to reduce it to then just this one not possible.
So, this one is possible gate profile I get the noise profile then I close it then I control a select all then transform noise reduction.
So, what it will do whole signal the signal is very long that is why it will take time whole signal noise will be subtracted as per the sample noise I have given to the system.
So, there is lot details are there signal processing details are there I am not going that.
