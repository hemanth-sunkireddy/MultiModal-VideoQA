vowel to consonant transition.
That means that articulator is producing vowel let us a, ca, then it want to produce vowel co.
So what is the effect?
The vocal chord has to be open and the articulator has to be closed.
So vocal chord opening is not started but articulator is moving to close to produce the co.
So once the articulator moving to close the air flow is reduced the sound in the if you see the formant structure is changing.
