There is a frequency axis.
So, this is 2 kilo Hertz, 4 kilo Hertz, 6 kilo Hertz, 8 kilo Hertz.
So, sampling frequency is 44 kilo Hertz.
So, up to 20 kilo Hertz it is there, 22 kilo Hertz, f s by 2.
Now, if you see the black portion are contain the high power.
So, if I say within 2 kilo Hertz most of the sections are black.
So, that contain the high power.
Now, if it is noise kind of sound if you listen it.
