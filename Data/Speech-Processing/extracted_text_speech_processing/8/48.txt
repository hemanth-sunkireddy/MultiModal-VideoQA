If this portion is silence, there is a bask, there is a beauty.
And difference between the ko and kha is rely only on aspiration.
So I, this is very, very, if I want to find out the high accuracy, I may not get it between the ko and kha.
So that now there is a another aspect is the ko articulatory effect.
I am not showing you this is the nonsense pronouncing the ka, ka, ka, ka, ka, ka, ka, ka, ka.
This is very means very well.
