Now if you see that this x axis which is written the sample number of sample as we discuss in signal processing that once you recorded the digital speech that this is x axis is sample number of sample or it can be time or sample then y axis is the amplitude if you see this the amplitude.
Now if you see this portion no speech that amplitude of the samples are very low almost close to zero line this is zero zero amplitude line.
