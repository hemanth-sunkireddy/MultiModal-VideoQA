So, here what is there it is called three dimensional plot of the speech signal.
What it is done if you are not a signal processing background then broadly you can think about like this that suppose I want to know that frequency analysis of the signal.
So, I have a time domain speech signal S n which I plot time versus sample value sample value or amplitude now I want to plot.
