All basic sounds will be same.
You can also see it.
I will share this all sound file.
You can see it.
All the basic sounds, if you see there is a maybe a ta, there may be a mo, there may be a no.
All kinds of sounds are there.
But if you see, once I play it, I cannot recognize it because I don't know the language.
But sound structure is same.
That's why we say IPA, International Phonetic Alphabet, which alphabet represent the sound only.
It does not depend on the language.
