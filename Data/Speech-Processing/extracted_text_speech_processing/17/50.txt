and create a sensation for 300 hertz signal may be will be different.
So, 300 hertz signal required more power to create the sensation, but 1 kilohertz signal required less power to create the sensation.
So, if I able to define the threshold of hearing, then for a particular you are defining the threshold of hearing hearing for measuring the intensity.
I can say let us define the frequency.
