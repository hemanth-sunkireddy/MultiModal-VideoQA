amplitude.
So, if I produce a you can say the let us 500 hertz acoustic signal it has a frequency it has an amplitude.
So, human being perceive frequency and also perceive as well as perceive the amplitude of the particular frequency.
So, two perception things is there.
Now I have to know how accurate we are in perception of amplitude and frequency.
