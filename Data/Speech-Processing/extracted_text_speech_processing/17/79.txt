because that can permanently damage your ear ok.
So, do not expose that things.
So, there is a sound propagation you know that even if a source is produced 120 dB you may say I am if it is I 10 feet away then you know the 1 by r square.
So, I is reduced in 1 by r square form.
So, if you distance is double 6 dB every doubling the distance 6 dB down.
So, if it is source away from the source 10 feet it will reduce the sound intensity.
