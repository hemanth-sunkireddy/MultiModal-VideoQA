or high frequency mechanical motions are amplitude or less.
So, that is why this high frequency sensor are in the beginning and in the apex are the low frequency sensor.
Now, each this kind of sensor acts as an responsible for a particular frequency range.
So, I can say let this is the basilar membrane, let this divided with a this is the sensors.
