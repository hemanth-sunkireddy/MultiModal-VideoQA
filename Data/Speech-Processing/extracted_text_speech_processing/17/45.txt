procedure is spectral envelope, spectral composition of this segment and this segment will be different.
So, pitch, loudness, timbre, perceptual dimension, fundamental frequency, intensity and spectrum envelope is the properties of physical dimension of the sound.
Similarly, you can see that there is a hue, brightness and sharpness, not shape, and then wavelength, luminance.
