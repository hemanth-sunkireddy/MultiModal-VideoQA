10 to the power minus 12 watt per meter square.
So, sound intensity of a sound is a physical quantity that can be measured and quantify acoustic intensity I define as average flow of energy through an unit area.
Area per you can say the power per unit area or force per unit area is nothing but intensity power per unit area is nothing but intensity.
So, watt per square meter I by I 0 is equal to minus 12 watt.
