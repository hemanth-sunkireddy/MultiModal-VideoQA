threshold of pain 130.
So, you see this we should not expose to the large amount of sound large or high amplitude of sound.
If it is high amplitude, it can create pain in our ear.
So, threshold of pain is 20 to 130 dB.
If I expose to a sound intensity of 130 dB, it can create a pain in the ears.
And also if I expose more than that, then my ear permanently can be damaged also.
