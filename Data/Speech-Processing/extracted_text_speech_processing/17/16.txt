down basilar membrane stimulation increase increases peak and peak quickly taper location of the peak if you see if the stimulation if the stimulation I have stimulated the cochlear and that increase the peak motion is.
So, I can say let us this is my basilar membrane this is my.
So, if I wave is mechanical wave is stimulated then this will be look like this wave is moving like this along the basilar membrane.
