fundamental then the formant frequency you know the formant frequency is nothing but a formant position in the speech so fast formant around 500 hertz ok if it is uniform to 500 hertz so almost 500 around 500 hertz will be the fast formant so i can say 3 to 5 percent so if it is 500 hertz then 3 divided by 100 into 500 so almost 15 hertz error in formant being
