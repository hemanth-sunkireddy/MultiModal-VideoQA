If it is possible that the human being will perceive 1 hertz, 2 hertz, 3 hertz, 4 hertz, 5 hertz, 6 hertz, 7 hertz and like that way or for a particular frequency in a band.
Similarly, if I increase the intensity, are we able to linearly perceive the intensity increase or in which scale, whether I able to differentiate between the 2 dB and 2.5 dB or 2.12 dB or not.
So, that is the resolving power of the human being.
