So, that is the pitch in perceptual domain.
So, main parameter physical domain parameter of pitch is called fundamental frequency or F 0.
Many places I referred to F 0 also F 0 fundamental frequency of that sound.
Then loudness intensity physical parameter is intensity I can measure the intensity 5 dB, 6 dB, 7 dB, but loudness is in perceptual parameter.
I can say this is louder sound.
