I can identify this sound is coming from harmonium, this is for tanpura, this is for let us guitar.
So, how do you find out?
All if the all pitch are same, if I say the fundamental frequency is the pitch.
So, pitch is an perceptual parameter, it may include something else for which we can understand this is the source of the sound is different, although they are produced in the same fundamental frequency.
