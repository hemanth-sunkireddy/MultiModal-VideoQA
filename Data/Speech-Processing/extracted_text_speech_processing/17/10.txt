So, now come to that we know that how human being perceive the sound, how human basilar membrane convert that mechanical motion to normal motion.
Now, think about in engineering model we said so basilar membrane response maximally to different input frequency, frequency tuning occur at basilar moment.
So, I can say that each of the tank circuit is responsible for a particular frequency band which is a constant Q filter.
