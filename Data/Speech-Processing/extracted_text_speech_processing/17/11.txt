So, I can say let this is particular frequency band, this is also responsible is particular frequency band.
Then I want to know is this band are linear or is this band are non-linear.
So, bandwidth of the each of the particular filter is it linear overlapping or non-linear overlapping?
How do you define that?
How do you I do know that things whether it is a non-linear and linear?
