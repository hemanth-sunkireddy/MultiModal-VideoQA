Why?
Because if you see in speech production side due to the radiation load the low frequency signals are high amplitude frequency or high amplitude compared to the high frequency.
So, the acoustics wave which is speech wave which is coming that has a high frequency or less amplitude compared to the low frequency sound.
So, the mechanical motion
