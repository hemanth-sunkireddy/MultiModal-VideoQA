So, this is called threshold of hearing curve for different frequency.
So, this is the minimum intensity required to create a sensation human ear.
Since the frequency response for different frequency the intensity frequency response of the intensity for different frequency the intensity of the sound perception is different that is why I said for 200 hertz I required a larger intensity sound.
