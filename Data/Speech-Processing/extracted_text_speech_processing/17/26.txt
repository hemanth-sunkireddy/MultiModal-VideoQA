0.3 by 100 into 1 k it is nothing but a 3 hertz.
So, if I say the perception of the frequency is different in different frequency range.
So, this is not a linear scale it is a non-linear perception.
So, how do you perceive if it is high frequency the difference the perception will be more rough I can say the bandwidth will be perception bandwidth is a larger.
So, I can say that initially for the low frequency
