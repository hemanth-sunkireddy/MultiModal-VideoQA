So, this first theory is that the basic of the temporal theory of the pitch perception is timing of neural firing which occur in response to vibration of the basilar membrane.
Timing of the neural firing is perceived as a frequency.
So, periodic stimulation of membrane match frequency of sound.
Once electrical impulse at every week, every peak.
Next one is called place theory.
Wave move.
