1 and find out the loudness scale and relation between the intense this is intensity and this is the loudness.
So, loudness and intensity relation this is the derivation of the loudness and intensity relation I am not deriving it again.
So, L is equal to 445 i to the power 0.333.
So, that can say if I know the intensity equal loudness in shown.
So, this will be shown S O N E.
