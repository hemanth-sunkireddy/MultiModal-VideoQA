my resolving power is very high, but at high frequency resolving power is very low.
So, that means, at high frequency I cannot separate the 2 less 3 1 kilo hertz and 1.100 1.03 003 3 hertz that I cannot kilo hertz I cannot separate, but at low frequency almost 1 hertz difference I can understand.
So, low frequency level
