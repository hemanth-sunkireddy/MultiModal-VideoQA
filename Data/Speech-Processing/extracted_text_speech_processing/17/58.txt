for water is 1 micro Pascal.
So, pre reference intensity in air is minus.
So, this is also depends on our the conducts the intensity the I said the threshold of hearing is the amount of sound pressure required to create a sensation in human ear for a 1 kilohertz acoustic wave ok.
So, I can if it is water then the amount pressure the medium is water
