Then, can I think that output speech which has collected using a microphone cannot, can it be analyzed using linear signal processing?
Yes.
So, that is from there the concept of linear prediction analysis comes.
So, this system can be linearly modeled.
So, from the signal if I want to find out the transfer function, that is why I want to predict the vocal tract constriction.
So, if I know the signal, yes it is possible to find out the signal.
