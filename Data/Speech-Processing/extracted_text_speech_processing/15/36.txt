of pole.
So, if there is a n number of pole, so n by 2 complex conjugate pole will be there.
So, each pair of complex conjugate pole give me a formant frequency.
So, if I have a 5 formant frequency, if I give you a spectrogram or let the I told you the spectrum of the pitch signal is like this 1, 2, 3, 4 that is f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, f 5, f 6, f 7, f 8,
