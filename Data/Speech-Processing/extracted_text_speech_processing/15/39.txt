then I can able to find out the transfer function of that Vogel trap.
So, complex conjugate now, so do not confuse with number of complex conjugate pole and pole, number of normal pole.
So, if there is a n-tube model, n-tube model is there, then I can get n by 2 complex conjugate pole.
So, there will be a n by 2 formant.
So, if I able to
