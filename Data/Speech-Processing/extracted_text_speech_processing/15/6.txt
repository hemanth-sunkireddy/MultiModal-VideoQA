plus Z d. If Z g is infinite, then R g is equal to 1.
Now, if I consider R g is equal to 1, then d z is nothing but a 1 plus R 1 R 2 plus R 1 z to the power minus 1 plus R 2 z to the power minus 2.
So, if it is nth order, if I can write that, if it is instead of 2 tube, it is n tube or I can say it is nothing but a.
