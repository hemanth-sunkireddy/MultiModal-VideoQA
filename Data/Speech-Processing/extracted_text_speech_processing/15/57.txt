or whole vocal tag can be n number of tube, but if I say n number of tube each tube cross sectional area is constant.
That is why uniform and lossless also because if it is lossy then all kinds of complexity will come up.
So, if it is lossless uniform tube model then it can be implemented using digital system that is V z.
Once I know that then I know yes if it is implementable via V z.
