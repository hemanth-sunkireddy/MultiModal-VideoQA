for radiation there will be a one single pole is required.
So, 2 plus 1 3 pole if I do that then I can get a z.
So, we will discuss about that how many pole of course, the order of the linear prediction analysis that things during the linear prediction analysis function what is the how do you get the order of the linear prediction that time we use this information.
So, this is the whole vocal tract tube modeling.
So, in summary I can say.
