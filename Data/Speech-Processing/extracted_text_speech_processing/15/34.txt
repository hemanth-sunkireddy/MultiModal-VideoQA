then I can get the resonant frequency.
And if the B k value is non-zero, then I get a bandwidth pole.
There will be a pole, there will be a formant which has a bandwidth.
So, B k provide me the bandwidth, theta k provide me the formant position.
So, this information will be used when we develop the model.
