using linear prediction model for speech production system.
So, if I know the theta k, if I know the theta k and value of r k, then I can model the system.
Theta k give me the formant frequency position and if r k tends to 0, tends to unit circle, amplitude of that pole is tends to your close to unit circle that give you the.
