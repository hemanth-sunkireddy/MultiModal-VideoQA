each of the chunk represent the formant frequency.
This is the first formant 1, formant 2, formant 3, so that will come.
So, each stage represent one formant frequency, each stage represent one formant frequency.
So, there will be n by 2 number of stage will be there.
So, if it is n by 2 number of stage, then n by 2 formant frequency will be.
