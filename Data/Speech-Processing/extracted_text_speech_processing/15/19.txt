cross sectional area of the different tube.
I can give you one example from Rabindran Seyfert that is written there is a different cross sectional area for a vowel.
I think either vowel which vowel I do not know that there is a vowel.
So, this vowel area functions is written.
Either I know the area function I can generate the vowel if I know the vowel I can derive the area function ok.
So, how do I digitally implement this?
