2, F 3, F 4.
Then if I ask how many complex conjugate pole will be there?
4 pair.
How many pole will be there?
Complex pole will be 8.
So, if n tube model is there, n number of pole is there in a transfer function, then I can say n by 2 complex conjugate pole will be there.
So, literally I can get n by 2 complex conjugate
