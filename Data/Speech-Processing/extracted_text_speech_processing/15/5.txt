R g minus R t. So, that is there in constant when we model in that boundary condition, when we model in boundary condition we said R g boundary condition modeling where here.
So, here I can say R g is nothing but a Z g minus Z d divided by Z g plus.
So, R g is nothing but a here I write capital R g let us consider small R g R g is Z g minus Z d divided by Z g.
