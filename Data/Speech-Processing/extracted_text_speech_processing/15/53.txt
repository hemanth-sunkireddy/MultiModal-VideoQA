and lip radiation and I get the speech signal.
So, random noise passes through vocal track and included lip radiation produce the speech for unvoiced speech.
If it is a voiced speech, impulse strain will be modified by the Guadal pulse generator and that will pass through the vocal track and lip radiation produce the speech.
So, if you see three Tufts pole function, G z can be approximate by the second order this two pole two pole function.
