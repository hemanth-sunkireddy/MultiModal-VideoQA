then there will be a product of pi equal to k k equal to 1 to n. So, v k I can say this two only this is v if I write v k this one then I do not write this product term ok. Now, if it is that then what is contribution of r k and v k?
Let us r k is equal to e to the power minus v k and v k is equal to so, v k is equal to minus
