So, if there is a pole in here, there will be another pole will be in here.
If the pole in here, there will be another pole will be here.
So, every pole has a complex conjugate pole.
If it is complex number, then alpha k I can say it is nothing but a r k e to the power j theta.
So, a complex number has a two pole, let this is the pole.
So, this has
