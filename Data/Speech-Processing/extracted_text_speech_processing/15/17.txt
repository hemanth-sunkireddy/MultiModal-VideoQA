divided by a k plus 1 plus a k. So, a k a are the area cross sectional area function of the tube different tube.
So, if it is a 10 number of tube consists of the vocal track is model using a 10 number of tube last r n r n is equal to 1 last one is equal to 1.
Then I can find out a k. So, r n I know r n. So, this is r k. So, I know r n r n is equal to
