Vector quantization initially this was very much used in speaker identification.
Last week I will take one class on speaker identification because I will just describe the problem and then I will say that how the vector quantization is used in there.
So basically vector quantization is nothing but a creating a you can say the training vector.
Suppose if I say speed speed speed speed ten times every time there is a different speed I produce.
Now should I store all ten speeds in a vector quantization?
I will say
