0 to 10 is divided in 5 level.
I can say 0 to 10 variation of x 1 is started from minus 10 to plus 10.
So, 20 is the variation.
So, I said there is a 20 variation is there.
Let equally divided that variation with a 5.
Then 5 division will be state.
So, that is vector quantization.
If you read this slide, you can understand that code book and vector quantization.
Details I will discuss later on in a
