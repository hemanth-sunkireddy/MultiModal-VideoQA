In written the word boundary are definite word boundary are there, but when I speak when I speak this one if I open that acoustic signal of this this boundary does not exist because this is a co articulatory sense speech signal is very complex.
So, there is a no definite word boundary in the spoken language.
So, I cannot say speech is a word how do I identify speech is a word from a spoken word spoken sentence.
