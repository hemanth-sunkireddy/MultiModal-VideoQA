I think in week one lecture that based on the manner of articulation and I identify the word, but in the similar kind of words are there like baba and kaka is there baba and kaka this kind of word.
Then I said the difference between the two words is only this is bo and this is co, but if you see bo is also a stop consonant co is also a stop consonant.
So, identify between this stop consonant by only differ by only place of articulation.
