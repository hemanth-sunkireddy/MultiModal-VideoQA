because this is also voiced, occlusion period is voiced, but it is a stop consonant.
This place is bilabial, this place is less scalar.
So, I have to identify the place.
So, identifying the difference between the two signals will vary in less.
So, if I if my vocabulary sizes increases, the similarity words will be increases and recognition will be further.
So, complexity of pattern matching will be increases.
