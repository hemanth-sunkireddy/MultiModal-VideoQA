in that time I use A m d f average magnitude difference ok.
There is other algorithm also f from maximum detection some magnitude difference all others methods are also adaptive filtering circular average magnitude difference function cumulative mean normalize different function.
So, all others methods also available.
Then frequency domain PDA pitch detection algorithm or f 0 detection algorithm frequency domain PDA operates on speech.
