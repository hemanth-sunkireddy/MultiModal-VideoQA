So, it is 0 minus.
So, x 0 minus x 0, x 0 minus x 1, x 0 minus x 2, x 0 minus x 3.
So, all for all deviation I am finding out the deviation and add them and find out the average value of the deviation.
Same next I calculate k equal to 1.
So, shift the c x instead of x 0 I put x 1, I put x 2, I put x 3.
So, all deviation.
