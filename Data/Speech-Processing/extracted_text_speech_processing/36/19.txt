the deviation will change or I can if I say suppose there is a long vocal region the amplitude has energy has changing then there will be variation will F 0 will occur here also.
So, that kind of energy amplitude problem is there.
So, autocorrelation is highly used and this is used when I can say I require a average rough estimation of F 0 is sufficient, but computational complexity will be very less.
