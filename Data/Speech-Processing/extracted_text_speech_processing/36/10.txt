that some pros and cause of autocorrelation technique.
So, computation efficiency can be improved if I if I use the FFT algorithm to implement that correlation the calculation of the correlation function ok.
So, this you can read it.
Now, instead of autocorrelation since autocorrelation is required the sample is multiply by the sample.
So, if it is a if you see if it is a 16 bit signal.
