So, distance between the harmonics is the fundamental frequency or inverse of the speech period.
So, what is the key philosophy behind the frequency domain PDA?
That if a signal consists F 0, then harmonics will be repeated F 0, twice F 0, 3 F 0, 4 F 0.
So, from there I can calculate the F 0.
So, main drawback of frequency domain PDA is the high computational
