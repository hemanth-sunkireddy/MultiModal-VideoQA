average deviation will be there.
So, deviation will be minima when it matched with the period.
So, if I plot the deviation, deviation plot will be look like this.
So, minimum deviation will be happen at the period or at the F 0.
So, this is F 0, this is twice F 0, this is twice F 0.
So, this can this technique is used.
