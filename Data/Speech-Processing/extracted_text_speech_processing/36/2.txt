I want only the central path because if you see the F 0 I want F 0 is or you can say the filtering also clipping and that F 0 is up to 500 is sufficient ok.
So, I do the central clipping in the signal and all the high amplitude variation can be avoided because high amplitude variation give me the autocorrelation function is log variation.
So, instead of taking the high amplitude variation signal.
