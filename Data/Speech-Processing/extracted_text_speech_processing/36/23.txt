harmonics are repeated, thrice F 0.
So, from there I can find, if this is 2 F 0, so I can find out the repetition distance and that give me the F 0 value.
So, how do you do that?
It is called Kuhn filtering.
If you remember the Kuhn has a peak and gap.
So, if I say this is F 0 beginning twice F 0, 3 F 0, 4 F 0, then I can find out the average difference between this gap.
