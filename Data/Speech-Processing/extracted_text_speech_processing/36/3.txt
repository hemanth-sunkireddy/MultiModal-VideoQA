0, I can clip the signal in central part and that signal can be used to find out the autocorrelation and calculating the F 0.
So, this the algorithm is very simple.
So, clipping how do you find out the C L?
Generally it is C L is one fourth of the peak.
So, how do you do that?
Suppose I have taken a 20 millisecond window signal.
So, within the 20 millisecond I can find out the maximum peak.
