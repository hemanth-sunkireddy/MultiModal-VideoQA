a point in here x 0 is equal to x k then I can get a point in here then I can get a point in here.
So, along the 45 degree line all x 0 which is matched with x k since which is not a you can say it is a not a exactly periodic signal then what is.
So, instead of calculating the exactly 45 degree line what I want.
