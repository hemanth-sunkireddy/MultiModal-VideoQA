pole on every 0 complex pole has its conjugate value.
So, if there is a pole in here, there will be a conjugate value pole in here.
So, it is the unit circle if all poles are lying inside the unit circle then we can say this is a causal and stable filter.
Now, how do we implement filter in digital domain?
So, I can say H z has an impulse response
