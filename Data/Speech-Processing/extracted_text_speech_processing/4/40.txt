is done based on fast Fourier transform algorithm.
So, FFT is not the transform, FFT is an algorithm to implement DFT.
So, that is why it is called fast Fourier transform algorithm, fast Fourier transform FFT.
So, FFT is an implementation procedure for DFT.
So, if I say the DFT is nothing but a x of k.
