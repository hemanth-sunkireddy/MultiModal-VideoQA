If you see, suppose I have a time domain signal, I have already showed you time domain signal and this is the, this portion I have selected, this portion of the signal I have selected and take the frequency response of the signal.
Now, there is a point, if I take n is equal to 1024 point, 1024 that means, order of the DFT is 1024.
So, I take the signal 1024 sample signal.
