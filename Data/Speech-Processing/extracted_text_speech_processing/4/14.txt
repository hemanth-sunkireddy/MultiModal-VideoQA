Fourier transform.
Here the time domain signal is discrete, but frequency domain it is continuous.
Time domain signal is discrete, but frequency domain it is continuous.
So, discrete time Fourier transform time domain it is discrete, but here discrete Fourier transform input is discrete and frequency domain also it is represented as a discrete.
So, this is a DTFT
