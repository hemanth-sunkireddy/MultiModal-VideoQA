So, once I increase the time domain resolution, my frequency domain resolution is decreasing.
So, if I take long signal, I time domain resolution is losing.
If I take small signal, frequency resolution is losing.
So, this is the limitation of Fourier transform.
That is why people are use more number of other number of transform like wavelet, EMD all kind of things is used.
