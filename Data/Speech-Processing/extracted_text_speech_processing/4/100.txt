1.5 kilohertz to 4 kilohertz.
So, I design that filter and shifted at 1.5 kilohertz, I get the high cost filter.
So, that way I can design the filter.
Digital filter design I am not going here because that you can that is prerequisite of this course that if you want to know the digital filter design, digital signal processing you have to study.
I just give you some concept of the or you can say that this is overview of DSP.
So, how to implement an IIR filter there is a lot of methodology are there.
