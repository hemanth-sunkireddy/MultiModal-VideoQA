instead of n equal to 1024 let us I take n is equal to 256.
Then my time domain resolution is increases because I my window size is very less.
So, I can get the better time resolution.
Now what is happen since f is equal to frequency resolution is nothing but a f s by n if n is decreasing the frequency resolution is also decreasing.
