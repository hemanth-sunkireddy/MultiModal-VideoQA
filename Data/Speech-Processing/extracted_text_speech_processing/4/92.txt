it will be convolution.
So, x k will be convolved with window function and then multiply with frequency response of the filter.
So, this is happening.
Details I will discuss when I discuss about the STFT short term frequency short term Fourier transform.
Now, if you see the example, example implementation for a time domain signal.
Suppose, I want to design a low pass filter cutoff frequency is omega c.
