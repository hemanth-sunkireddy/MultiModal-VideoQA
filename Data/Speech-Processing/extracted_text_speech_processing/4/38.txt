I will get 0, then 8 hertz, then 16 hertz, then 24 hertz, then let dot dot dot dot, then you have 48 hertz and then next one is 56 hertz.
So, my resolution does not support the 50 hertz.
So, the power, but the signal has only power at 50 hertz.
So, if I make the DFT, so instead of looking like 50 hertz single spike.
