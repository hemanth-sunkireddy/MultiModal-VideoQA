property will be repeated in here in mirror in nature.
So, I can take this one only to find out the frequency response of the signal.
Then DFT magnitude when a real input signal contain a sine wave component a peak amplitude a 0 the integer number of cycle n then cycle over input sample then it is nothing but a m r equal to a 0 into.
So, amplitude of the signal
