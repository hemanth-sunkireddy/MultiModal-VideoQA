I require 3 bit this is equal to 3, 3 bit I require.
So, I can see the 3 bit I can generate 7 number.
Now, to do this odd and even distribution what I do that access the signal in bit reversible format.
When you access the signal the index term reverse the bit, if it is 10 bit reverse the bit.
So, what I will do I reverse the bit.
