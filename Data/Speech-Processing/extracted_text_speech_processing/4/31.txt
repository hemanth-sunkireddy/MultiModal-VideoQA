If this signal is sample, this x n is sample is 8 kilohertz and my n is equal to 1000, then I can say 8 k divided by 1000 into k, I get the corresponding frequency.
So, instead of 0, I can write 0, this will be let us frequency f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4 for different k value, I get the analog frequency value.
Now, if you see here f is equal to 0, so x 0,
