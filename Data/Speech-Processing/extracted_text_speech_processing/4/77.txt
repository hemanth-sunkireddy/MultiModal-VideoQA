after 5 kilohertz I want signal or system should not produce let signal should not produce any response.
That means, that filter is that filter frequency response is that up to 500 kilohertz or 500 less 500 hertz I want response should be like this and after 500 hertz I do not want anything.
So, that means, 0 to 500 hertz.
