domain, multiply both and get the output and take the IDFT, get the input.
So, these are the two implementations, either frequency domain implementation or time domain implementation.
So, have you understand?
Either I can implement the filter in time domain or I can implement the filter in frequency domain.
Now, suppose I want to implement the filter in time domain or frequency domain or any domain when I want to implement.
