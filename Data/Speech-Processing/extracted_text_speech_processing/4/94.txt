and then I can implement it in time domain.
So, if you see the book there is a different so different window has different type of transition bandwidth and peak side lobe.
So, this is the ripple in peak side lobe and this is the transition bandwidth.
So, if I rectangular filter the order of the filter is m then transition bandwidth delta is nothing but a 4 pi by m. So, m is the
