So, how do you can do it?
That is why it is called fast Fourier transform.
So, instead of n cross n, can I use some other method which can be computationally reduce which can reduce the computational cost of the DFT.
One method is called fast Fourier transform.
I will discuss only Radix II algorithm, other you can study from the DSP book.
So, Radix II algorithm is most commonly used algorithm.
