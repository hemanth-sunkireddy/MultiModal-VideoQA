So, where the amplitude is 1 to 0 is transitory, so that transitory portion that frequency range is called transition bandwidth.
So, if you say normalize edge then the peak repeal pass band, peak repeal in stop band and normalize transition bandwidth.
So, this point to this point is called normalized transition bandwidth.
So, this is pass band frequency, this is a stop band frequency where I want to stop the filter.
So, this bandwidth is called stop
