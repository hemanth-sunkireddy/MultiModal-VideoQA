with the DSP concept will be used later on.
There is another important DSP concept is there that is will be used I am not just explaining this curve that is called discrete Fourier transform.
I think many of you know that one is called discrete time Fourier transform DTFT discrete time Fourier transform another is called DFT discrete time Fourier transform.
