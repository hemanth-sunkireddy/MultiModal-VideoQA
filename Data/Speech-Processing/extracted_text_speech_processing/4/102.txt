then if you do not understand the particular point then you read that dsp book proakis banalokis or whatever ah digital signal parsing book you can read and also you can post that i am not understand this portion then i will help whatever way i can do because if i just consider the dsp then i am not able to complete the speech part so i am just truncated that just i just for summarize the dsp required dsp things in here and some dsp also i require higher end dsp signal signal signal parsing algorithm i will be used
