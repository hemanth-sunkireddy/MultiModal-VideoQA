where you want to implement the band pass filter.
Similarly, suppose I want to design a high pass filter of 1.5 kilohertz.
If the sampling frequency of the signal is 8 kilohertz, then in frequency scale, what is the maximum signal?
Up to 8 kilohertz I can get.
Baseband signal is 4 kilohertz again.
Even I can get the baseband signal is 4 kilohertz.
So, it is nothing but a band pass filter.
