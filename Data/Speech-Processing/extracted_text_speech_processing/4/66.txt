spectrum this is the normal spectrum.
So, then once I get the spectrum I get the formant frequency plot.
So, that means I know the formant frequency representation of the signal and details I will come STFT when we discuss.
Now this is called spectrum now when you draw this kind of representation this is called spectrogram.
So, difference is that spectrum is frequency versus power means the power of each frequency plot.
