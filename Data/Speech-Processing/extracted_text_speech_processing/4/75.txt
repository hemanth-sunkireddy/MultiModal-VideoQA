If I implement using infinite impulse response, n varies from minus infinity to plus infinity, then I call IIR filter, infinite impulse response filter.
So, one is finite impulse response, another implementation procedure is infinite impulse response.
So, let us discuss about the FIR filter which is called finite impulse response filter.
