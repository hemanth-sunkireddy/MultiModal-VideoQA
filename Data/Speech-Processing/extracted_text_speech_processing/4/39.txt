it will be look like this power will be distributed at adjacent computation point.
So, this will be look like this.
So, this is the DSP computational leakage.
Then there will be another another effect windowing effect also will be come I will discuss later on when we design the filter.
Now, you know that implementation of DFT is a discrete Fourier transform.
