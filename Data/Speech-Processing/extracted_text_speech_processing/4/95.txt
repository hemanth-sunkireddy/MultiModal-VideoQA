order of the filter if it implement the filter in FIR way.
So, I said finite impulse response ideally and filter has an infinite impulse.
So, I truncated the infinite impulse to a finite number if it is m then m is called order of the filter.
Ideally if I want to design a low pass filter this is infinite impulse response once I truncated it I cannot get this half.
