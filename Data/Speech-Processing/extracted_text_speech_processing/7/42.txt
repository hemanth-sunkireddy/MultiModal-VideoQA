So, if it is a biased bilabial stop, that means either it can have a bow or it can have a bow, that it can be have a aspirated biased bilabial stop or it can have a unaspirated biased bilabial stop.
Now, if I see the picture after recording, if I see the spectrogram and the picture, if you see this is Co, you see here this is Co, then VOT is aspirated and VOT is longer.
