is velar, kha is velar, gha is velar, gha is velar.
Only difference is the manner of articulation.
If I say kha is unvoiced, unaspirated.
During the production of the kha, the back of the tongue touches the velar position, but vocal cord is open.
So, there is no voicing during the occlusion.
That is why it is called unvoiced.
