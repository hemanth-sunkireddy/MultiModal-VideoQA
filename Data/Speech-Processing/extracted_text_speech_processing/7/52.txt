There is another important thing.
I said that vowel or F1 F2 plane all the cardinal, this is called cardinal diagram.
So, cardinal vowel diagram it is called.
Vowel can be placed.
If I place the Bengali vowel, it will look like this.
Back and front is F2.
Height is defined by F1.
Close or open is defined by F1.
So, it is F1 and F2 plane.
So, I can see that different vowels.
