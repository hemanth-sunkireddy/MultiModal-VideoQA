I do not know what is the saw.
This saw is palatal or post alveolar, post alveolar saw.
So if it is, if it is unvoiced friction, then I can write F, this kind of, not F, there is no cut, this one.
So it is a flotion plus friction, two kinds of sounds are there, that is why it is written in two symbols.
