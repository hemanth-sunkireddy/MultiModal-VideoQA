There is a nozzle stop.
So that is velar nozzle.
If that nozzle is produced, that we call velar nozzle.
So then there will be nozzle sound which is velar nozzle.
I just pervert the symbol of the velar nozzle.
I can go to the IPA chart and find out the symbols for the velar nozzle.
If I say the velar nozzle, it will look like not callback.
