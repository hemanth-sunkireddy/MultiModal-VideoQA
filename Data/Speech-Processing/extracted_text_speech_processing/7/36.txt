touches the dental region to produce the flushing part and after the flushing tongue is curled, the tongue is pushed back and touches the post alveolar region to produce the friction.
Then we can write the symbol tau is the flushing part.
So it is written by T and this saw is the friction part which is written by the post alveolar saw.
So I can write post alveolar or palatal saw.
