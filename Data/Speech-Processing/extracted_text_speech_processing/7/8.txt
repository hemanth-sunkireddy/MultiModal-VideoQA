If I want to produce the ka during the ko, the back of the tongue touches the velar position and it is totally closed, cavity is totally closed.
Then suddenly it has to be burst to open, when the cavity will be, the constriction will be open, then there will be a burst sound and it will release.
So if I see the sound plane, I will show you in the wave diagram also, acoustic signal.
