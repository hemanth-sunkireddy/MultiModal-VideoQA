medium is homogeneous, pressure change across the small distance, there is no friction in air particle, air particle velocity is small, sound is adiabatic.
Now, if I want to derive that equation, what I will do?
Let this is p 1.
So, I can say p 1 is nothing but a p 1 acting on the pressure.
So, it is p of x t, not capital P, small p. Okay.
