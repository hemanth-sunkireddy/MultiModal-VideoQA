but the average particle velocity is 0.
So, let the particle velocity is v small v and that also function of x and t. Now, if it is a pressure wave condensation and relaxation condensation and relaxation.
So, density is also change.
So, density is also function of x and t. So, in equilibrium, the velocity is 0.
So,
