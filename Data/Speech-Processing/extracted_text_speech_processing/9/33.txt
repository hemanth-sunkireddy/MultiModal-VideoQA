the volume is decreases, but mass of the cube will be remain same and this is an adiabatic condition.
So, I say there is a when the sound wave is propagated there is a no conduction of heat ok. Now, if that is the theory so using this three law we have to derive the wave equation.
So, again I can if you see the slides the assumption I have said.
