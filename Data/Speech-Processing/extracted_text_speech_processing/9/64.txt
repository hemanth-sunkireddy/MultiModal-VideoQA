how the pressure wave is propagated I know in the tube.
Now, I have to derive.
So, pressure wave mathematical equation I know, but I do not know what is the solution of the p. So, I have to second order differential equation.
I can solve that second order differential equation and find out the equation for p solution of the second order differential equation.
And then try to find out how what should be the transfer function of this vocal tract tube ok.
So, next class we try to derive.
