Now, if I want to model it, the complexity is that human speech production model is not a simple single tube.
If I have a, if you see in high secondary also you have studied that there is a single tube, if this end is closed and a sound is generated here, you know what kind of frequency you accept, what kind of sound you expect from the sound that depends on the length of the tube.
