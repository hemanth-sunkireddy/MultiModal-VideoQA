the pressure change is a function of position and time.
Now, if you see if I change if I apply a pressure ok, then what will happen the particle will start moving inside the tube, but average velocity of the particle is 0 because medium is homogeneous when sound wave is propagated medium does not change.
So, that means the particle velocity is exist
