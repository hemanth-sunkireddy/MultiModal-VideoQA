and this is also a 1.
So, pressure into a 1 give me the force let us this is f 1 which is acting on this plane and force which is exiting from this end is nothing but a p 2 a 1.
So, difference of force is the cause of the motion of this particular this block.
So, I can say Newton's second law of motion the force equal to mass into
