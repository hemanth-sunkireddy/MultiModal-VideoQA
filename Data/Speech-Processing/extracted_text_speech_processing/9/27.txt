Now, how the pressure from x equal to 0 is propagated along the tube, let us at x equal to L I want to know what is the pressure.
So, I want to know the pressure movement equation, mathematical equation of the change of pressure with respect to position and time.
And also mathematical equation for particle velocity with respect to position and time and also the relation between the.
