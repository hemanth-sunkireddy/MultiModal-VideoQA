that the structure the tube the cross sectional area of the tube in all section is not same.
So, two complexity one is that cross sectional area of the tube is not equal in every length.
So, if I say this is the glottis or this is the vocal cords this is the x equal to 0 and this is at the lip if you see this is the if this is the lip or if the dental and then there is a lip if I say there is a lip.
So, and at lip let us x equal to 0.
