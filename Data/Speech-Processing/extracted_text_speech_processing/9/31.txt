acceleration.
So, the force resultant force cause an acceleration of that cube which is nothing but a force equal to mass into acceleration mass of the cube into acceleration.
Now, second law said the gas law of the hydrodynamic accelerate pressure volume and temperature under the adiabatic condition.
So, what is the meaning if I apply a pressure on this
