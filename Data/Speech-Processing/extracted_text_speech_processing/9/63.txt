with the any particle velocity with the x y and y and z direction.
So, let us I say the wave is propagated along the x axis and there is a not other directional particle velocity.
So, friction force is not there, viscosity loss is not there.
So, nothing is there.
Then this is my velocity pressure equation, this is my velocity equation.
Now, I what I know, I know in the tube how the pressure wave is propagated.
