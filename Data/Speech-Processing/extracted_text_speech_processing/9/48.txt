So, instead of that I can write c is equal to root over of gamma r t by m where I derived that I am not deriving that one c is equal to so that that you can derive from the place of the adiabatic condition that if you required you can see the book and that is available and I can next day I can also that do that also if you required.
You send me the mail if it is required then I can derive that things also or you can see that my another lecture in audio system engineering.
