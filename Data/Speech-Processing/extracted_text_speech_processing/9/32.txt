this block suppose there is a block I apply one plane one pressure is applied.
So, if it I apply a pressure the volume will be changed.
If the volume is changed mass should be changed, but mass will not change.
This increase the density due to the conservation of mass, mass will remain same density will be changed.
Volume will be changed because that cube will be deformed due to the applied pressure ok.
So, although the if the pressure is increases
