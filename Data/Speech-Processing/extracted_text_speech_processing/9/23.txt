let us the that is the average pressure or atmospheric pressure what that is p 0.
Once the piston apply a force pressure then let us that is p. So, change pressure is a function of the piston may apply a force in here, how the pressure will propagate it that depends on the position where I am taking the position that x equal to 0 to L. So, this depend on the position and time.
So, change of pressure.
