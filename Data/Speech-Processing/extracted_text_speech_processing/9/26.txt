I say medium is homogeneous.
So, I have already said some assumption I have taken that amplitude of the pressure wave is within the limit where the sound is transmitted linearly that is why we call this linear wave equation.
Now, if it is linear wave equation then how do I derive that wave equation?
So, what do you understand by the wave equation?
That means,
