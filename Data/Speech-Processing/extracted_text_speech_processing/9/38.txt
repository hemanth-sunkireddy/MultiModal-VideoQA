Now, if I say what is the force acting on this plane multiply by the area.
So, it is A 1 multiply by A 1.
So, I can say the A 1 is multiply.
So, it is A 1 is multiply.
So, it is nothing but A 1 del p by del x into del x.
So, what is A 1?
It is a cross sectional area of this area.
So, this is nothing but a del z into del y.
So, I can say it is nothing but a minus.
