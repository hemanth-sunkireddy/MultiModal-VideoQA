So, I have to know how the wave is sound wave is propagated along this tube, along this tube.
Now, you have studied already studied that wave equation you know the wave propagation equation.
So, what is tell that if I produce a sound can I mathematically express the.
So, if I produce a sound, sound is propagated in the medium with a condensation and relaxation condensation and relaxation wave.
