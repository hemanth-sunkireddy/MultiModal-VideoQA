pressure wave pressure with respect to position time with the particle velocity with position and time.
So, that I want to know that is why I want to know the derive those equation.
So, for deriving those equation you already studied it may be in acoustics or in wave equation derivation in first year physics.
We consider three principles of physics one is called Newton second law of motion second is called gas law of therionics.
