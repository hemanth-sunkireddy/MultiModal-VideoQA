and another one is conversion conservation of mass.
Think about if I apply a pressure in this this plane ok.
So, change of pressure and the pressure is exist in this plane is let us p 2 this is p 1 then I can say the pressure difference.
So, pressure if p 1 is the pressure then I know the pressure into area let us a 1 is the area.
