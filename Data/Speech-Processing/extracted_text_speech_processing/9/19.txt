that propagation become non-linear.
So, I said amplitude is less with the limit within the limit and sound is propagated linearly in the medium and medium is also homogeneous.
Then we can derive the linear wave equation.
Similarly, here also we try to derive the linear wave equation, how the wave is propagated along the tube.
Let us try to do that.
