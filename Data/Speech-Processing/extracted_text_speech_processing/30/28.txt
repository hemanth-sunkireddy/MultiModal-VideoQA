it is nothing but a x of n divided by w 0 into p of minus infinity to infinity w p minus n. Now, if I say y n is equal to x n only if this part is equal to w 0 or I can write capital W. So, then, what happens?
W n is equal to 1.
So, this is y n. So, this is y n. So, now, we will write this part as capital W. So, I have written down this part as capital W. So, now, we will write down this part as capital W.
