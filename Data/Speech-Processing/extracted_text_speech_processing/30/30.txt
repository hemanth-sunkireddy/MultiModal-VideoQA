of the Fourier transform where k equal to 0.
So, DC component which is nothing but the average of all sample average of all sample give me the DC component.
So, here this is should be equal to W 0 ok. Now, if it is W 0, so sum of value of square some sequence.
So, this is obviously sum of sequence is nothing but the
