I cannot take whole signal at a time and analyze its frequency domain and do some modification in frequency domain and take the inverse to get the time domain signal.
This is not possible because the signal is non-stationary, some part is modified.
So, what I say I want to take part of the signal and analyze it in frequency domain and do some modification, take the inverse transform.
