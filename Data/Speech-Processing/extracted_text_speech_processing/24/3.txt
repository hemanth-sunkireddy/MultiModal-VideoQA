ok. And then we try to solve this linear equation ok.
So, whether it is a autocorrelation methods or covariance methods there is a two step.
First step is to compute this phi using correlation for covariance method using autocorrelation for autocorrelation methods.
Next try to solve this p p linear equation p number of linear equation.
