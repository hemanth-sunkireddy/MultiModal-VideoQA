to find out the value of alpha.
So, I can say autocorrelation methods and covariance methods both are two step.
Step one computation of matrix of correlation value and then efficient solution of set of linear equation ok. Now, this lattice method says that can I combine this two step that says that I do not want to use that autocorrelation compute correlation.
