alpha k i minus 1 predictor it is.
So, it is not ith or i i minus 1 iteration z to the power minus k minus k i into z to the power minus i.
So, if I if I do it the sum k equal to 1 to i then this will be sum together.
So, it will be same as this one ok.
So, I just from the summation term only one alpha k z to the power minus i term ith term I have taken out.
