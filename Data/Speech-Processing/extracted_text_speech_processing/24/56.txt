minus K i into b i minus 1 m minus 1, where K i is the Parker partial reflection coefficient ok.
So, I can say the forward prediction error can be expressed in top of previous forward prediction error and backward prediction error.
Similarly, backward prediction error can be expressed in top of previous backward prediction error and forward previous forward prediction error.
