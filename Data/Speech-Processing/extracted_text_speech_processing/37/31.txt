where all the abbreviation they are full form will be there.
So, once I get the abbreviation I am going to run through the dictionary and get the full form.
And that text normalization for number it is difficult because you do not know where what kind of number system is required because sometime if I write 943091556 is a phone number then I can say this have to read this have to read as 943091556 we never said.
