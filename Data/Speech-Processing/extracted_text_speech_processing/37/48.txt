somewhat simple, but Bangla is not that simple, but in case of Hindi we found that it is little bit of simple compared to other language because since we have a syllabic language then the pronunciation whatever we write we almost pronunciation to pronounce the same, but it is not always true there may be some variation.
In Bengali there is a lot of variation in written script increase of English there is also lot of variation.
So, but if you see the unfortunately English pronunciation dictionary is available in the net.
