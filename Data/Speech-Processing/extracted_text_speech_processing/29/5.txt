We have taken part of a speech signal.
Then what we have done?
We have taken that if you remember the example, suppose I have a 16 kilohertz sample signal.
I have recorded 3 second of my speech.
Then I have 4800 sample in 3 second.
So, I have not taken all sample at a time and done that STFT analysis, done the Fourier transform.
Then it is very easy.
I take whole signal at a time.
