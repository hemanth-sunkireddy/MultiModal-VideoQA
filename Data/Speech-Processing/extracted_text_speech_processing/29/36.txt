B must be greater than the 2 pi by n. So, number of channel if it is n. So, distance between the two channel is 2 pi by n. This must be less than the bandwidth of the analysis window.
So, there is a two condition is there.
STFT is completely invertible if l is greater than the bandwidth of the analysis window.
So,
