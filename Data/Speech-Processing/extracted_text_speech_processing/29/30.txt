Second limitation is that I have said the sample by sample recovery.
So, I have shifted the window one sample which may not be necessary.
Only thing is that that consider x in a band because the dissemination factor is L. So, STFT is applied for every L sample.
So, x of W of n is nonzero over the nW.
nW is the length of the sample.
