I can get back the signal.
So, if w 0 is non-zero then only I get back the signal ok.
So, which is already explained if you see in here this slide.
So, I have taken a this is my f n m is my frame signal which is nothing but a x m multiplied by the window function.
I take the DFT and then I take the I DFT.
