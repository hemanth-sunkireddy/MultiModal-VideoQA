So, spectral amplitude, dynamic range or compression or loudness log.
So, if I see each tone has an amplitude.
Now, perception of that tone, that particular frequency depends on the threshold of hearing.
So, perception of amplitude for all frequency is not same.
I have to go through the equal loudness curve.
