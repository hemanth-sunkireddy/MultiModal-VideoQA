a basilar membrane filter by a filter bank non-linear filter bank.
So, there is a pre-filtering.
Pre-filtering means since it is a digitized signal.
So, what I can do?
I can develop a pre-filtering after ADC.
So, that high frequency and low frequency signal are cut up and then I pass the signal through a band pass or you can say the chunk of band pass filter which is called basilar membrane or you can say critical band filter.
