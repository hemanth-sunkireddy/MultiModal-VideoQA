How you got?
That means spectral dynamics told you is the 200 hertz is the fundamental frequency.
So, along the spectrum is also important and you can see the segmental and suprasegmental both information are necessary.
So, dynamic features is also necessary.
The how the spectral dynamics is changed that also is necessary.
So, dynamic features is changed in the importance compression of loudness.
