Then, Lyons Cochlear Model, same things.
So, acoustic signal, outer ear, middle ear, pre-emphasis.
So, acoustic signal is if we pass through a, you can see we have a this kind of frequency response of the middle ear and outer ear.
So, this can be pre-emphasized.
Signal can be pre-emphasized using inverse response.
After the pre-emphasis, I can pass the signal out.
