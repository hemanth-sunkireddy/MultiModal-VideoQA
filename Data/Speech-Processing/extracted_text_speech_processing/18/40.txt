histogram is nothing but a model of cochlear hair cell transduction.
This transduction, this motion how it is transduced this motion to the transduction is done place take place that is model here.
How it is model?
165 channel equal space on a log frequency scale between 150 to 700 hertz 150 channel filter sorry 165 channel filter.
So, each cochlear filter design match neural tuning curve of
