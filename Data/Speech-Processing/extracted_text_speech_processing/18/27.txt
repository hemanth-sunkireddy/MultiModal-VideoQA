modeling or how human being perceive the frequency.
So, perceptual effect include the most auditory model, spectral analysis on a non-linear frequency scale, spectral amplitude compression, loudness compression via logarithmic scale.
So, we are not, we are not, you can say that physical loudness is not, physical intensity is not equivalent to the perceptual loudness.
So, there is a logarithmic compression is there.
