After 500 hertz, the bandwidth is non-linear.
So I can find out how many critical band is required to cover the 0 to 20 kilohertz.
So that bandwidth is called Bach scale.
So those are the critical band, pictures of critical band.
And again I will discuss when we think about the MFCC kind of things.
So, Bach scale.
