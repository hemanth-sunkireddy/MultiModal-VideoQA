amplitude.
So, I can develop a scale on which human being perceive the frequency.
If you see it will come look like this.
So, this scale is called male scale which is a logarithmic scale, ok.
So, I can say the human perception of frequency that I can derive by experiment.
This axis the frequency.
So, I generate a pure tone of different frequency and I generate a pure tone.
