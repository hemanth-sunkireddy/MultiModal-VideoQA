Decrease sensitivity at lower frequency, you know that lower frequency are very, we are sensitive to the lower frequency, but higher frequency average, that is the bandwidth, critical bandwidth, critical bandwidth is very big.
So, average, so resolution, human resolution of the higher frequency is very rough, I can say roughly approximate.
So, I can say decrease sensitivity at lower frequency and increase sensitivity at, decrease sensitivity at lower frequency or you can say the change of perception of the frequency and lower bandwidth.
