4 log 2 f by 1000 sorry 100 1000 if it is f is greater than 500 hertz.
So, that means, within 500 hertz bandwidths are 100 hertz bandwidth with overlapping if it is 50 percent overlap.
So, that is a band 100 hertz bandwidth then from 50 hertz another 100 hertz bandwidth.
So, up to 500 hertz bandwidth are linear 100 hertz.
