So, I can say spectral amplitude compression as per the equal loudness curve I have to do.
So, I can dynamic range or amplitude of the spectrum has to be compressed as per the threshold of hearing.
The hearing sensitivity of the human ear to the amplitude is not same or not equal to all frequency.
So, as per the sensitivity is changing along the frequency.
