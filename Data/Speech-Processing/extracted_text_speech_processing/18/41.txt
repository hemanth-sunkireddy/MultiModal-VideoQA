for CATS minimum phase filter array of level crossing detector that model motion of neural activity transduction of the inner hair cell and then we sum it and get the response.
Details you can also study if it is required then cochlear filter design how it is designed then EHI response overall EHI response that is EHI measure the spatial extent of coherent neural activity across.
