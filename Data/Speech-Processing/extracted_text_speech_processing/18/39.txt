human being.
Then there is another model.
So, this is the lion's cochlear.
This I will come later on spectrogram.
Then ensemble interval histogram E I H model.
So, the model of cochlear hair cell transduction.
So, I can say this along the bocellar membrane there is a lot of there is a cochlear hair cell sensors.
Each sensor consists of 10 fiber.
So, that E I H ensemble interval
