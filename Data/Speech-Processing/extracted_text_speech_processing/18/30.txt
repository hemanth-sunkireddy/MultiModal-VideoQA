Perceptual linear prediction, this is called PLP, only known as PLP.
So, these details I will cover during the linear prediction analysis.
This is called perceptual class linear prediction.
Then, SNP auditory model, lion cochlear model, gamma tone filter bank model or inner ear or inner hair cell model.
So, all are called auditory modeling of human speech processing.
So, let us I just discuss one or two model and then you can study it.
