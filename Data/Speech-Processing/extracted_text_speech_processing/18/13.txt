Next, you have, I have discussed it during that basilar membrane that we perceive that each sensor along the basilar membrane is corresponding to a particular band of frequency.
So that means the ear cannot distinguish the sound within the same band that occur simultaneously.
Suppose a cochlear that along the basilar membrane particular band of frequency is perceived by a one sensor.
