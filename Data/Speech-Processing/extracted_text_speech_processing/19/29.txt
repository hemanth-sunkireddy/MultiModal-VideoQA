So, let us the value is come around 28000 for a one sample.
So, it is 32000 plus and 32000 minus if it is maximum possible.
Now, if it is 28000 if you square it, the number will be integer number will be very high.
So, instead of squaring the signal, what I can do?
I can find out the short term average energy, short term average magnitude energy.
