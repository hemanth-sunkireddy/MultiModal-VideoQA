find out the number of zero crossing of 80 sample.
So, let us m sample then Z 1 is nothing but a 2 f 0 by f s into m. So, next class we try to derive the generalized formula how do I find out the zero crossing for non periodic signal or you can say the for speech signal or the periodicity quasi periodic signal.
So, for there
