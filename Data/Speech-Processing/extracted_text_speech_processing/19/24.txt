What kind of time domain parameters are there?
So, I can say short term energy.
So, for every window I can find out the short term energy of the speech signal.
So, suppose let us application side you can come.
Suppose I have a speech signal there is a voicing, then there is a let us noisy part, then there is a silence part, again there is a voicing part and then again there is a silence part.
