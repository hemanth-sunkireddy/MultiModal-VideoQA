it is sorry it is a sum of magnitude if I want to make it average 1 by put 1 by L here.
So, I can normalize it also 1 by L L number of sample are there.
So, I can 1 by L I get the average.
So, average magnitude.
So, using this to see that.
So, this is some plot of of those two parameter you can extract after recording your name extract that n. So, I give you the.
