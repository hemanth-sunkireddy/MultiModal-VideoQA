So, that I can easily understand.
So, short term energy is one kind of parameter.
Then short term average magnitude, short time energy or short time average energy or short time average magnitude.
Now, what is the problem in energy?
When I calculate energy, the signal X n has to be square up.
So, every sample value let us if it is a 16 bit speech sample.
