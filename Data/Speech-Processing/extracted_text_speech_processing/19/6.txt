So, if I want to know that information, if I take the whole signal at a time and find out the energy.
So, it give me the average energy or if I make it average then 1 by I can make the average also.
So, if I make the average, so I can get either total energy or average energy of the whole signal.
So, that information is whole signal energy is ok, but that does not give me any kind of parameter by which I can process or I can use this those parameter.
