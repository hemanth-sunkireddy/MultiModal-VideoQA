Sometime if it is voice bar like this, so I do not know whether it is a voice bar and whether it is a noise.
So for that purpose we use another parameter, but at least using EN I can find out where the speech signal has high energy, where it is there is no energy that I can find out.
So this can be used as a voice detection.
You plot it and see it how it is behave like.
