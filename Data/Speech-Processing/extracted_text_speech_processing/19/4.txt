So, speech is not a stationary signal.
So, what I say that if I take this portion of the speech the property is different if I take this portion of the speech property is different ok.
So, speech is changing along the time.
Now, what happened suppose I want to find out the energy of this whole signal.
So, I can easily find out energy E is nothing but a summation of n equal to minus infinity to infinity.
