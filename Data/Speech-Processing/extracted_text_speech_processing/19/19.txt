and some part of the consonant.
So, I lose the transitory part.
So, instead of 100 millisecond, so if I small amount signal processing problem, large amount signal I lose the time resolution.
So, what I want?
I want a optimum length of the window, so that it does not effect so much.
So, I can say let us 20 to 25 millisecond of window if I take, then one transitory period roughly 40 millisecond.
