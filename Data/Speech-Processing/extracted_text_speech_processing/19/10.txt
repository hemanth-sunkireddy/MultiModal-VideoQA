50 sample.
Now, the problem is that if I do that things then what will happen since this boundary in this boundary effect will come in the processing.
So, there may be a this boundary I just this boundary may be fall in a very large signal.
So, that this sample is included this window and this window energy will be less.
So, what I want to know I want to remove this boundary effect also.
So, then what will do?
