can be represented by a additive signal.
So, what kind of transformation I should do, so that convolution become simple addition.
So, if you see the slide this figure represented the homomorphic system for convolution.
So, x n some kind of transformation d then is represented as the instead of convolution I get x 1 n plus x 2 n.
