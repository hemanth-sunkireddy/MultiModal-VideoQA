sum of the x 2 is overlap with x n then it is difficult to separate.
So, what do you want we want in principle of homomorphic signal processing.
So, importance of homomorphic system is the speech processing lie in their capability of transforming non linearly combined signal to additively combined signal.
So, basic purpose is that transform the non linearly combined.
So, I want that convolution signal.
