0.5 to 0.96, 0.95 to 0.96 to 0.97 those are the variation.
Then what I will do?
I do the framing.
What kind of framing?
I have a fish signal, I extract, I put the window length one window red color to red color one window, then I shifted the window if it is 50 percent shifted, if it is 20 millisecond and 10 millisecond shifting, then 50 percent overlap.
So, for each each window for each frame I can get frame 1, frame 2, frame 3.
