this is h k this is nothing, but a multiplication of e k. So, if I take the DFT here discrete Fourier transform or if I represent the speech signal in frequency domain.
So, this is nothing, but a product of spectral representation of vocal track with the spectral representation of source excitation source.
So, if I say
