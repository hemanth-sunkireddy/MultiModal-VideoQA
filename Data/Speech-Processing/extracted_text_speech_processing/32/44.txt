So, if x cap n is my real shape term, then I can say the complex shape term, then the real shape term is nothing but a x cap n plus x cap minus n divided by 2.
This prove I will do in the next class.
So, this can be proved real shape term is nothing but a complex shape term plus x cap minus n divided by 2.
