i will show you the result in the end then f 0 model fujisaki generation process model we have done it so what i have i have already explained that spectrum information and duration information we training from the hts engine and we extract that f 0 contour and modify the f 0 contour based on the action command or phase command by the fujisaki model and then we synthesize the speech so in that case fujisaki generation process model so action component and phase component rule has to be generated
