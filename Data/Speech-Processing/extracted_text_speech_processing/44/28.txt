So, what is there you know that if the if the this is the Fuchisaki equation you see the phase component is the action component.
So, phase component magnitude and phase lead time if the if the original phase boundary is here where it is started.
So, that the that lead time is required ok.
So, that lead time and then phase action command magnitude and action command lead and lag time what is the action command.
So, if you see in here issue there is a
