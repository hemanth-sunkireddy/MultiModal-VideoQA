That utterance means within a single without resetting this whole system whatever I produce is called single utterance.
After each and every utterance the system is reset means all prosodic parameters start from new things.
So, that is prosodic break I can say prosodic break is the utterance.
So, if there is a long gap generally if it is gap may silence more than 300 millisecond then you find that prosodic the prosodic parameter is resetted.
So, I can say this is a utterance.
