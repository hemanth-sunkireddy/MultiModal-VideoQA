means if you see I will show you we have draw a what kind of binary curve where we can say whether this phase is dependent on this or not.
If it is far away it is far away or suppose this phase is depend on this phase and this phase is depends on this phase that the distance in case of this distance will be 1 and in this case of this distance will be 2.
So, if the distance increases there is a probability of pause increases.
