In between a word in continuous speech, there is no boundary because there is no silence.
We never said one word, then we pause, and then say the next word.
We never said that way.
But pause in appropriate position has an important role to convey the information.
You know that.
If I put the pause in arbitrary position, then speech becomes unnatural, and also the meaning of the speech may also change.
