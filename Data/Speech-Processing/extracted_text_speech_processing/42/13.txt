Suppose, I record a long sentence, it may contain three or four utterance because there may be an utterance.
After the utterance, there is a more than 400 millisecond pause.
Then we can say this is a single utterance, although this is part of a same sentence.
In spoken language, the utterance is the chunk.
In written language, we take a sentence as a chunk.
This is the sentence level and utterance level.
In the utterance, there inside there is a pause.
