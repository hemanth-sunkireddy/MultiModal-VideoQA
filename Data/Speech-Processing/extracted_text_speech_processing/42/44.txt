three parameters, then we realize these three parameters, then after analyzing we try to develop a linear model using these three factors, so that we can predict the pause.
So, one is called occurrence probability prediction, whether for after this word or after this phase there will be a pause or not, whether there will be a pause or not, whether there will be a pause or not, so that we probability we have calculated.
