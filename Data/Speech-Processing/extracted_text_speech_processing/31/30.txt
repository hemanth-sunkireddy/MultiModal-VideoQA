frequency component of the signals.
So, if you see this these slides there is a this is the spectrum information and if you see the if the red line is the envelope of the spectrum and those peak peak of the envelope denotes the formant.
So, if I say formant is my features.
So, I have to extract those formant how do I find out those formant.
So, I have to find out an algorithm.
