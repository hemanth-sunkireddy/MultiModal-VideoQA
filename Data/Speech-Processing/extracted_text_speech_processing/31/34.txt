then I call time domain features.
From the frequency domain representation, from this representation if I extract the features, then I call frequency domain parameters.
So, based on this analysis, we can say there is a three types of parameter, frequency domain parameter extraction or three types of parameter extraction methods.
One is called frequency domain parameter extraction methods, time domain parameter extraction method, time frequency both parameter extraction methods.
