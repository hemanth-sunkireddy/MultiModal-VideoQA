So, there is a non overlapping filter there may be less non overlapping 100 hertz to 200 hertz then 200 hertz to less 300 hertz.
So, each filter has a particular pass band.
So, from the each pass band I will get the power if that particular frequency component is there in the speech signal.
So, if there is any component 0 to 100 hertz
