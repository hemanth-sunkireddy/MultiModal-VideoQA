If you see in parameter domain there is a lot of speech parameters or features one is called filter bank.
So, features parameter extraction methods lot of like LPC we have discussed LPC parameter extraction method we have discussed.
So, there is a frequency domain parameters there may be a time domain parameter.
So, features can be extracted from the time domain representation of the speech signal.
So, if the speech signal is this.
So, I from the time domain representation I can extract the features.
