and extracted parameter are called parameters.
So, if the extract LPC parameter extraction extracted using LPC LPC analysis, then all coefficient a 1, a 2, a 3 all are called LPC parameters.
So, those represent the speech signal for a particular speech segment ok.
So, if the features is extracted segment wise.
So, it is all features are extracted.
