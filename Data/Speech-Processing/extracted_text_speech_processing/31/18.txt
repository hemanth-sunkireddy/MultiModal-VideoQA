non natural features.
Now, the problem is feature extraction is that whatever the features is there the extraction procedure must be robust.
That means, what is robust?
That means, if this is the speech signal if I this time I extract the features if the next time also I extract the features I will get the same features for the same speech signal and they should exactly represent the segment.
So, sometime this features is very high.
