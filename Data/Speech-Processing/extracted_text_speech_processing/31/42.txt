then I call frequency domain parameter, if they are extracted from the time domain representation of the signal then I call it is a time domain parameter.
So, pitch features natural features like phoneme we are not extracted really.
So, what we are doing we try to design an algorithm by which segment or you can say the framing I done the framing of the speech signal frame by frame speech.
