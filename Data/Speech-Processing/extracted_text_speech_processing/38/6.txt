which can simulate this thing is fantastic.
So, that people are doing this articulatory modeling lot of research is going on in articulatory modeling, but this is a very tough because with respect to time suppose I calculate the cross sectional area for O one frame next frame the composition will be change.
So, mathematical model is change.
So, those kind of compute heavily computational complex problem is there, but research is going on that is called articulatory synthesis.
Then there is a parametric synthesis.
