And then I can excite that model by a either a impulse or a noise to generate the speech.
So that is called articulatory synthesis.
So, lot of research is going on in articulatory synthesis because it not only provide me the speech synthesis also I can simulate the human vocal track also.
If I able to construct mathematically or I can I can say that instead of this if I able to make a some student.
