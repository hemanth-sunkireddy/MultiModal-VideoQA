using this kind of parameter that is why it is called parametric synthesis.
So, formant synthesis is called parametric synthesis it is developed based on set of parallel filter because nothing if I know the formant frequency I can design that filter and based on the gain of that formant I can pass the impulse response to particular formant and can generate that speech signal.
So, that is called formant synthesis.
Then there is a HMM synthesis using V coder.
