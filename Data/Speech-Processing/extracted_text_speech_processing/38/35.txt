So, the synthesis rule is simple C V C if you see that I can I can generate C C B V V C C B and fade out of V O means fade out.
So, if you see the version is there then V C V if the segment is V C V then I can generate like this way if it is C V Y V I can generate like this is.
So, those rules are the synthesized part.
So, those is this is called Yassinola
