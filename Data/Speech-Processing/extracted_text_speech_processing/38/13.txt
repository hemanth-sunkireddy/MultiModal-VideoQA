and that time the diphone based synthesis was there then there is a call unit selection then unit unit selection with prosody modification and last one is h m m base synthesis also it is two types the one is called h t s one is parametric another is non parametric only the choice of the segments are detected by the h m m model so that is h m m base pitch synthesis which is also used in convective synthesis ok so now i have not discussed about this thing already discussed formant synthesis does not use any human speech sample at run time instead of it puts synthesis speech as a create using acoustic model
