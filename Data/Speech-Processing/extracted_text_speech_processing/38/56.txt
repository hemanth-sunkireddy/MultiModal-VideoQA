synthesis, because here what you do speech data base is there we extract the excitation parameter.
So, if you see the speech signal consist of two part one is called segmental supra segmental or I can say it consist of two part one is called excitation parameters another is called spectral parameter or you can say if I have a vocal track vocal track is excited by a vocal chord.
So, I can say excitation parameter and vocal track parameter.
So, this is called spectral parameter.
