parameter and this is called excitation parameter.
So, we have extract we have separate from a large speech database with this we have separate the excitation we have the excitation parameter and also we have a spectral parameters.
Based on these two parameter we developed HMM parameter estimation technique ok. Now, once the text is come input text.
So, text analysis is done contextual labeling is done.
