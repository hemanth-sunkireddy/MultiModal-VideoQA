and then I can cut the occlusion period plus burst is my co. Then from the burst end of the burst to steady state vowel is my co to vowel transition.
Then I do not require the steady state vowel because I can repeat the last period many times how many I required and then there is a vowel to consonant transition.
So, it is there will be a vowel and there is a consonant transition.
So, V C portion will be there and then again there will be the consonant which is occlusion plus burst.
