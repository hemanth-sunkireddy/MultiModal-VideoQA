if I zoom this portion, if you see the vowel period look like same.
So, if I cut it here in one of the epoch position of the every vowels, one vowels, then from here to middle of this to middle of this, then I can say it is a diphone and when I added them different diphone the error will be minimum.
So, because the steady state is nothing but a steady portion of the diphone.
