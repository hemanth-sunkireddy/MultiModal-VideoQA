the models are changing that means constriction area will be changed, air flow dynamics will be changed.
So, if we all change the model composition is changing.
So, this means that I require lot of mathematically you can that is the super model that which can take this kind of variation.
So, that I can generate the articulatory speech, but it is very good things that if I am able to generate this I will mathematically model this thing with respect to time.
