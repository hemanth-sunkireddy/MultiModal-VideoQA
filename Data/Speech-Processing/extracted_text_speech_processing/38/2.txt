So, based on the technique three types articulatory synthesis parametric synthesis and quantitative synthesis.
So, if you see the articulatory synthesis is the if you if you remember the tube modeling class.
So, what we try to develop is the mathematical model of the human articulator.
So, if I able to mathematically model the human articulator then if I.
