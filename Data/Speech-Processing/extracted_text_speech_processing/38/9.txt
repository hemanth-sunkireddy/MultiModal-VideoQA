is dynamic the that that the it is not static that this frame it is x this frame it is y it is continuously moving.
So, speech formants are moving continuously.
So, co articulatory effect while it is moving from one form to another formant how the formant is moving is very important.
So, that formant dynamics I have to know.
So, that formant dynamics if I able to apply then I can generate the speech.
