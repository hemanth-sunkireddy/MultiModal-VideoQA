It is very tough to record all those things.
And also, if I recorded, then matching is very tough because some part of sentence will be same some other way, next part will be sentence speaking some other way.
So, all kinds of problem will be generated.
So, what will they said?
Instead of recording word, sentence, all kind of things, initially they thought if I record only the diphone.
So, for a particular language, if I have a phoneme, how many phonemes are there in English?
