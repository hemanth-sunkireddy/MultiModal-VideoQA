Top Related Sentences with Metadata:
- [2.srt | 00:01:19.590 -> 00:01:30.569] So what is a linear regression? It is one of the simplest kind of supervised learning model. And it predicts a real value number which is regression.

- [2.srt | 00:00:06.419 -> 00:00:26.550] In this video, we're going to talk about linear regression. So we'll begin by the definition of linear regression, and we'll talk about how this model can optimize to get the best estimate value. And then we're going to talk about important quantities for linear regression, such as a fitness performance metric, things like that.

- [2.srt | 00:00:05.429 -> 00:00:17.170] Hi everyone. In this video, we're going to talk about linear regression. So we'll begin by the definition of linear regression, and we'll talk about how this model can optimize to get the best estimate value.

- [2.srt | 00:04:20.089 -> 00:04:40.349] And this is called linear combination. So this type of model, whether we have many variables or one variable, that shows some linear relationship of the variable to the target and this type of model is called the linear regression. Let's take an example.

- [2.srt | 00:00:09.619 -> 00:00:30.570] So we'll begin by the definition of linear regression, and we'll talk about how this model can optimize to get the best estimate value. And then we're going to talk about important quantities for linear regression, such as a fitness performance metric, things like that. And we'll talk about how statistically significant these estimate values are.

- [2.srt | 00:04:13.289 -> 00:04:34.989] this becomes my linear model. And this is called linear combination. So this type of model, whether we have many variables or one variable, that shows some linear relationship of the variable to the target and this type of model is called the linear regression.

- [2.srt | 00:04:22.079 -> 00:04:42.909] So this type of model, whether we have many variables or one variable, that shows some linear relationship of the variable to the target and this type of model is called the linear regression. Let's take an example. This data is coming from Kaggle website.

- [2.srt | 00:01:50.079 -> 00:02:06.859] And importantly, linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. Well, what does that mean? It means the feature, let's say we have only one feature for now, has a linear relationship to the target variable.

- [2.srt | 00:01:40.769 -> 00:01:58.969] That means the user doesn't need to figure out some design parameters in advance or during the training. And importantly, linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. Well, what does that mean?

- [2.srt | 00:01:07.469 -> 00:01:24.949] And our goal is to tweak this parameter by optimization so that the model makes a prediction that's close to the target as much as possible. So what is a linear regression? It is one of the simplest kind of supervised learning model.
